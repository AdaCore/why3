 (* Add element el (term) to info_model.
    If an element with the same hash (the same set of attributes + the same
    location) as the element el already exists in info_model, replace it with el.

    The reason is that  we do not want to display two model elements with the same
    name in the same location and usually it is better to display the last one.

    Note that two model elements can have the same name and location if why is used
    as an intemediate language and the locations are locations in the source language.
    Then, more why constructs (terms) can represent a single construct in the source
    language and more terms have thus the same model name and location. This happens,
    e.g., if why code is generated from SPARK. There, the first iteration of while
    cycle is unrolled in some cases. If the task contains both a term representing a
    variable in the first iteration of unrolled loop and a term representing the variable
    in the subsequent loop iterations, only the latter is relevant for the counterexample
    and it is the one that comes after the former one (and that is why we always keep the
    last term).
