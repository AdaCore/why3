(** This file contains the transformation with arguments 'induction on integer' *)

(** Explanation *)

(* Explanation for induction base goal of induction tactic *)
let base_case_expl = "base case"

(* Explanation for recursive case *)
let rec_case_expl = "recursive case"


(* Documentation of induction:

   From task [delta, x: int, delta'(x) |- G(x)], variable x and term bound, builds the tasks:
   [delta, x: int, x <= bound, delta'(x) |- G(x)] and
   [delta, x: int, x > bound, (forall n, n < x -> delta'(n) -> G(n)), delta'(x) |- G(x)]

   x cannot occur in delta as it can only appear after its declaration (by
   construction of the task). Also, G is not part of delta'.
   In practice we are "chosing" delta'. The minimal set delta' such that this
   transformation is correct is Min_d = {H | x *directly* appears in H} â‚¬ delta'. (1)

   Adding any declarations to delta' should be safe(2).

   In practice, we define delta' iterately beginning with the goal (upward) and
   adding any hypothesis that contains symbols defined in a set S.
   Algorithm used:
   S : symbol set = {x} union {symbol_appearing_in goal}
   delta' : list decl = {}
   For decl from goal to x_declaration do
     if ((symbol_appearing_in decl) intersect S) != {} then
       add decl to delta'
       add (symbol_appearing_in decl) to S
     else
       ()
   done


   (1) One may be convinced of this because it is possible to make a lemma of
   the form "forall x: int. Min_d(x) -> G(x)" with appropriate abstract constant
   symbol for every other constant (added in the context). One can then apply
   an induction on this reduced example and apply this lemma on the initial case.
   (This is an argument for the "reduction of context stuff" not a claim that
   the induction is correct)

   (2) If it does not talk about x, we will have to prove it (unchanged) to be
   able to use it in the recursive part. So it should not change the provability.
