(** [split_pos_full f] returns a list [[g1;..;gk]] such that
 [f] is logically equivalent to [g1 /\ .. /\ gk] and the length

 conjunctions under disjunctions and on the left of implications *)

    connectives. In this case, [split_proof_full] works as [split_pos_full]
    but stops at the [stop_split] attribute and removes it. *)
