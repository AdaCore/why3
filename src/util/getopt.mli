Short keys represent [-l] options. Long keys represent [--long] options.
Some options can support both formats at once, e.g., [-l] and [--long].

For long-key options, if the handler is [Hnd1], an argument has to be passed
as [--long=value]. If the handler is [HndOpt], it can be passed either as
[--long] or [--long=value]. If the handler is [Hnd0], it has to be passed
as [--long].

For short-key options, if the handler is [Hnd1], an argument can be passed
either as [-lvalue] or [-l value]. If the handler is [HndOpt], it can be
passed either as [-l] or [-lvalue]. If the handler is [Hnd0], it has be
passed as [-l].

Short-key options with [Hnd0] or [HndOpt] handlers can be passed in
concatenated form, i.e., [-abc] is parsed as [-a -b -c], assuming the first
argument has a [Hnd0] handler.

If [--] is passed, all remaining arguments are considered as raw arguments.

val commands: string list ref
(** [commands] hold the name of the currently running command,
    [Sys.argv.(0)] by default. *)

val parse_one : opt list -> string array -> int -> int
(** [parse_one opts args i] parses argument [args.(i)] using the option
    list [opts]. If the argument is not an option (or if it is option
    [--]), [i] is returned. Otherwise, the index of the next unparsed
    argument is returned. The function raises [GetoptFailure] if the
    argument is either an unrecognized option or its required value is
    missing. If the option list does not change depending on parsed
    options, [parse_many] might be a better choice. *)

val parse_many : opt list -> string array -> int -> int
(** [parse_many opts args i] parses arguments from [args] starting at
    index [i], calling [parse_one] in turn. It returns the index of the
    first argument that is not an option. When [GetoptFailure] is raised,
    the function calls [handle_exn] to terminate the program. If the
    option list is static, [parse_all] might be a better choice. *)

val parse_all : ?i:int -> opt list -> (string -> unit) -> string array -> unit
(** [parse_all ~i opts extra args] parses all the arguments from [args],
    starting from index [i] (1 by default), calling [parse_one] in turn.
    When [GetoptFailure] is raised, the function calls [handle_exn] to
    terminate the program. When an argument is not an option, it is passed
    to [extra]. If an argument is [--], all the remaining arguments are
    passed to [extra] in turn. *)

val format : ?margin:int -> opt list -> string
(** [format ~margin opts] turns the option list [opts] into a string that
    is suitable for usage message. The first word of a description name the
    argument of the option (if any). Description remainders are aligned
    at column [margin] (25 by default). If an option does not support
    arguments, its description string should start with a space. *)

val handle_exn : string -> unit
(** [handle_exn args exn] terminates the program after printing the content
    of the [GetoptFailure] exception. The content of [commands] is used as
    the program name for the error message. *)
