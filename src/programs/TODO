o get rid of types Pgm_ttree.{ipattern, pattern} (use logical patterns instead)

o bug in test-pgm-jcf: scope

o freshness analysis

o no `old' in loop invariants
o use of old in loop invariant should be reported as an error (correctly)

o syntactic sugar for postcondition:
  { pat | q } stands for { let pat = result in q }

  particular case { x | ... } to use x instead of result
  but also { a,b | ... }, etc.

  Andrei: bad idea

o automatically add a label pre_f at entrance of each function f
  and then replace (old t) by (at t pre_f)
  (so that there is no more 'old' in the abstract syntax)

o what about pervasives old, at, label, unit = ()
  in particular, how to prevent old and at from being used in programs?
  can we get rid of theories/programs.why?

o program alias, e.g.

    let f = String.create

o library
  x Array
  x String
  x Buffer
  x Char
  - Hashtbl
  x Queue
  x Stack

  - List
  - Map
  - Set
