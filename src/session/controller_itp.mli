    file is kept in the session, without any corresponding new theory,
    that is as if it was an empty file (TODO: such errors should be
    returned somehow by the function [reload_files])

  - each new theory is associated to a theory of the former session if
    the names match exactly. In case of no match:

    . a new theory and its goals appear without any proof attempts in
      it in the new session

    . an unmatched old theory is kept in the new session together with
      its former goals, proof attempts and transformations, but
      without any tasks associated to goals and subgoals.

  - within a new theory with a corresponding old theory, each goal is
    in turn associated to a former goal if possible. the match is done
    either on the goal name, or if no name match exactly, on the goal
    shape.

    . a new goal without match is added with an empty set of proof
      attempts and transformations

    . an old goal without match is kept with all its former proof
      attempts and transformations, but no task is associated to it,
      neither to its subgoals.

  - on each new goal that has a matching old goal, old proof
    attempts are attached, with the status obsolete if the task has
    changed

  - on each new goal that has a matching old goal, old
    transformations are attached, and applied to the task, the
    generated subgoals are in turn matched to the old sub-goals, in
    the same manner as for goals in a theory

    . an old sub-goals without a match is kept with all its former
      proof attempts and transformations, but no task is associated to
      it, neither to its subgoals.
