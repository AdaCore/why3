(** [reload_files c] returns a pair [(o,d)]: [o] true means there are
    obsolete goals, [d] means there are missed objects (goals,
    transformations, theories or files) that are now detached in the
    session returned.

  If parsing or typing errors occurs, a list of errors is raised
  inside exception Errors_list.

  The detailed process of reloading the files of the given session is
  as follows.

  - each file is parsed again and theories/goals extracted from it. If
    some syntax error or parsing error occurs, then the corresponding
    file is kept in the session, without any corresponding new theory,
    that is as if it was an empty file (detached mode)
    (those errors are returned as first component

  - each new theory is associated to a theory of the former session if
    the names match exactly. In case of no match:

    . a new theory and its goals appear without any proof attempts in
      it in the new session

    . an unmatched old theory is kept in the new session together with
      its former goals, proof attempts and transformations, but
      without any tasks associated to goals and subgoals.

  - within a new theory with a corresponding old theory, each goal is
    in turn associated to a former goal if possible. the match is done
    either on the goal name, or if no name match exactly, on the goal
    shape.

    . a new goal without match is added with an empty set of proof
      attempts and transformations

    . an old goal without match is kept with all its former proof
      attempts and transformations, but no task is associated to it,
      neither to its subgoals.

  - on each new goal that has a matching old goal, old proof
    attempts are attached, with the status obsolete if the task has
    changed

  - on each new goal that has a matching old goal, old
    transformations are attached, and applied to the task, the
    generated subgoals are in turn matched to the old sub-goals, in
    the same manner as for goals in a theory

    . an old sub-goals without a match is kept with all its former
      proof attempts and transformations, but no task is associated to
      it, neither to its subgoals.

  When the option [hard_reload] is true (false by default), libraries and
  drivers are also reloaded.
