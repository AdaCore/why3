(** Shapes *)

(* Backward compatible but not used in recent shape version *)
type shape

(* This shape representation is not just a classic "summary" of a task as
   [shape]. Each declaration shape of the whole session is recorded in the
   session (see Gshape.gshape for these global field) and associated to a
   unique index. The [bound_shape] is just the list of integers corresponding to
   the shapes of declarations.
   These shape are used from recent shape version *)

val dumb_checksum: checksum

(** Pairing algorithm *)

module type S = sig
  type 'a t
  val checksum : 'a t -> checksum option
  val shape    : 'a t -> shape * bound_shape
  val name     : 'a t -> Ident.ident
end

module Pairing(Old: S)(New: S) : sig
  val associate:
    use_shapes:bool -> 'a Old.t list -> 'b New.t list ->
    ('b New.t * ('a Old.t * bool) option) list * 'a Old.t list
    (** Associate new goals to (possibly) old goals
        Each new goal is mapped either to
        - [None]: no old goal associated
        - [Some (h, false)]: the matching is exact (same checksums)
        - [Some (h, true)]: inexact matching (thus proofs for the new goal
          must be assumed obsolete)

        if [use_shapes] is set, the clever algorithm matching shapes is used,
        otherwise a simple association in the given order of goals is done.

        Note: in the output, goals appear in the same order as in [newgoals]

        the second list returned is the list of non-associated old goals.
