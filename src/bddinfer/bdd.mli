  val get_max_var : unit -> int
    (** Returns the number of variables [max_var].
        Default value is 0, which means that bdds cannot be created
        until the module is initialized using [set_max_var]. *)

  type view = Zero | One | Node of variable * t (*low*) * t (*high*)

  (** Accessors *)

  val var : t -> variable
      (** The root variable of a bdd.
          Convention: [Zero] and [One] have variable [max_var+1] *)

  val low : t -> t
  val high : t -> t
      (** The low and high parts of a bdd, respectively.
          [low] and [high] raise [Invalid_argument] on [Zero] and [One]. *)

  (** Constructors *)

  val zero : t
  val one : t

  val make : variable -> low:t -> high:t -> t
    (** Builds a bdd node.
        Raises [Invalid_argument] is the variable is out of [1..max_var]. *)

  val mk_forall : (variable -> bool) -> t -> t
  (** [mk_exists f b] (resp. [mk_forall f b]) quantifies bdd [b] over
     all variables [v] for which [f v] holds. For example: [mk_exists
     x. x /\ y] produces [y], [mk_exists x. x \/ y] produces [one],
     [mk_forall x. x /\ y] produces [zero] and [mk_forall x. x \/ y]
     produces [y]. See [test/quant_elim.ml]. *)

  val extract_known_values : t -> bool BddVarMap.t
  (** [extract_known_values b] returns a map indexed by variables,
     associated to Boolean values.  In that map, a variable [v] is
     associated to [true] (resp. [false]) if bdd [b] entails [v] to
     have this value, that is [b -> v=true] (resp [b -> v=false]) is a
     tautology. *)

  (** Generic binary operator constructor *)

  val apply : (bool -> bool -> bool) -> t -> t -> t

  val constrain : t -> t -> t
    (** [constrain f g] is the generalized cofactor, sometimes written
        [f ↓ g]. It is defined for any function [g <> false] so that
        [f = (g /\ (f ↓ g)) \/ (~g /\ (f ↓ ~g))]. Setting [g] to a variable [x]
        gives the classical Shannon cofactors:
        [f = (x /\ (f ↓ x)) \/ (~x /\ (f ↓ ~x))].
        For [f' = constrain f g], [f' xs = f xs] if [g xs], the graph of
        [f'] is often simper than that of [f], but not always.
        Note also that [(∃xs, (α ↓ β)(xs)) = (∃xs, (α /\ β)(xs))], but
        [constrain] is, in general, less costly to calculate than [mk_and].

  val restriction : t -> t -> t
    (** For [f' = restriction f g], [f' xs = f xs] if [g xs], and the graph of
        [f'] is a subset of that of [f].
        I.e., [f'] is a smaller version of [f] for input vectors in the
        "care set" [g].
        See, e.g., Raymond 2008,
        "Synchronous program verification with Lustre/Lesar", §7.9. *)

  (** Builds a propositional formula from the given BDD. The returned
     formula is only build using if-then-else ([Fite]) and variables
     ([Fvar]).  *)

  val as_compact_formula : t -> formula
  (** Builds a ``compact'' formula from the given BDD. The returned
     formula is only build using conjunctions, disjunctions,
     variables, negations of variables, and if-then-else where the if
     condition is a variable.  *)

  val is_sat : t -> bool
    (** Checks if a bdd is satisfiable i.e. different from [zero] *)

        [b1] implies [b2] *)

  val count_sat : t -> Int64.t
    (** Counts the number of different ways to satisfy a bdd. *)

  val any_sat : t -> (variable * bool) list
    (** Returns one truth assignment which satisfies a bdd, if any.
        The result is chosen deterministically.
        Raises [Not_found] if the bdd is [zero] *)

  val random_sat : t -> (variable * bool) list
    (** Returns one truth assignment which satisfies a bdd, if any.
        The result is chosen randomly.

    (** Return statistics on the internal nodes tables (one for each variable).
