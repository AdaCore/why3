Instructions to build TryWhy3
-----------------------------

* in subdirectory src/trywhy3/ do

  ** install 'ace'

     git clone https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds.git

     copy the mode-why3.js file to the ace-builds/src-min-noconflict directory:

     cp mode-why3.js ace-builds/src-min-noconflict

  ** install Alt-Ergo

     - get sources of Alt-Ergo and put them in directory src/trywhy3/ e.g. in

       src/trywhy3/alt-ergo/

     - apply the patch alt-ergo.patch

       cd <alt-ergo dir>
       patch -p1 < ../alt-ergo.patch

     - compile Alt-Ergo

       ./configure
       make byte


* in the main directory

   ** if necessary, change the following line of Makefile.in to point
      to Alt-Ergo sources

      ALTERGODIR=src/trywhy3/alt-ergo

   ** [optional] If you want to build a standalone trywhy3 that can be
      run without a Webserver, the example files must be present at
      compile time. See the step 'To add predefined examples' in the
      'customization' section below and populate the examples/
      directory of the trywhy3 source directory accordingly *before*
      building trywhy3.


   ** compile with

      make trywhy3


* install
  you can build a package with

  make trywhy3_package

  this creates a tarball containing a directory trywhy3/ which you can put on a webserver.
  You may want to add a symlink from index.html to trywhy3.html (or rename the file).



* customization

  ** install a file trywhy3_help.html that will be shown when clicking
     the help button.

  ** To change the theme used by the ace editor widget, add the
     relevant theme-*.js file to the ace-builds/src-min-noconflict/
     directory and update the variable definition at the top of the
     trywhy3.html file

  ** To change the look and feel of the rest of the application, edit
     the file trywhy3_custom.css.

  ** To add some predefined examples, put some .mlw or .why files in the
     examples/ subdirectory and generate an index as follows (assuming you
     are in your trywhy3 directory) :

     cp some_file.mlw examples/
     cd examples/
     ../gen_index.sh *.mlw > index.txt

  ** [optional] If you want trywhy3 to only use its embedded files,
  change the variable declaration 'var load_embedded_files = false;'
  to 'var load_embedded_files = true;' in the header section of
  trywhy3.html.
  Note that this is the default behaviour when trywhy3.html is opened from
  a file:// URL rather than an http(s):// URL, regardless of the value of
  the load_embedded_files variable.
