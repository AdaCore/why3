Instructions to build TryWhy3
-----------------------------

* in subdirectory src/trywhy3/ do

  ** install 'ace'

     git clone https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds.git

     copy the mode-why3.js file to the ace-builds/src-min-noconflict directory:

     cp mode-why3.js ace-builds/src-min-noconflict

  ** Download the latest version of Font-Awesome in a directory named 'fontawesome' :

     git clone https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome.git fontawesome


  ** install Alt-Ergo

     - get sources of Alt-Ergo and put them in directory src/trywhy3/ e.g. in

       src/trywhy3/alt-ergo-1.00-private-2015-01-29/

     - apply the patch alt-ergo.patch

       cd <alt-ergo dir>
       patch -p1 < ../alt-ergo.patch

     - compile Alt-Ergo

       ./configure
       make byte


* in the main directory

   ** if necessary, change the following line of Makefile.in to point
      to Alt-Ergo sources

      ALTERGODIR=src/trywhy3/alt-ergo-1.00-private-2015-01-29

  ** compile with

      make trywhy3


* install
  you can build a package with

  make trywhy3_package

  this creates a tarball containing a directory trywhy3/ which you can put on a webserver.
  You may want to add a symlink from index.html to trywhy3.html (or rename the file).


* customization

  ** install a file trywhy3_help.html that will be shown when clicking the help button.

  ** To change the theme used by the ace editor widget, add the
     relevant theme-*.js file to the ace-builds/src-min-noconflict/
     directory and update the variable definition at the top of the
     trywhy3.html file

  ** To change the look and feel of the rest of the application, edit
     the file trywhy3_custom.css.

  ** To add some predefined examples, put some .mlw or .why files in the
     examples/ subdirectory and generate an index as follows (assuming you
     are in your trywhy3 directory) :

     cp some_file.mlw examples/
     cd examples/
     ../gen_index.sh *.mlw > index.txt
