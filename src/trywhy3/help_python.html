    <h1>Online version of Why3, with Python input format</h1>

    This version of Why3 is intended for teaching purposes.
    Its input format is a tiny subset of Python, called "micro-Python"
    and described <a href="https://www.why3.org/doc/input_formats.html#micro-python">here</a>.

    <p>

    Note: the command-line version of Why3 is also supporting this
    input format, for files with suffix <tt>.py</tt>.

    <h2>Verifying a program</h2>

    <p>
    Click on the gears button to launch the verification.
    Verification conditions (VCs) then appear in the right panel, in
    the Task List tab, and
    Alt-Ergo is run on each of them with a default time limit (that
    can be set in the Settings menu).
    </p>

    <p>
    When a VC is not proved, there are several options:
    <ul>
      <li> use the contextual menu to rerun Alt-Ergo with a larger
      time limit (e.g. 1000 or 5000 steps instead of 100);
      <li> use the contextual menu to split the VC and rerun Alt-Ergo
      on each sub-VC (split and prove);
      <li> use the Task View tab to investigate the problematic VC,
      for wrong or missing elements of specification (precondition,
      postcondition, invariant);
      <li> add intermediate assertions in the code, using <tt>#@
      assert ...;</tt>.
    </ul>
    </p>
