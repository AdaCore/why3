    <h1>Online version of Why3, with Python input format</h1>

    This version of Why3 is intended for teaching purposes.
    Its input format is a tiny subset of Python, called "micro-Python"
    and described below.

    <p>

    Note: the command-line version of Why3 is also supporting this
    input format, for files with suffix <tt>.py</tt>.

    <h2>Syntax of micro-Python</h2>

    Notation: The grammar of micro-Python is given below in extended
    Backus-Naur Form, using | for alternation, () for grouping,
    [] for option, and {} for repetition.
    Special symbols <tt>NEWLINE</tt>, <tt>INDENT</tt>,
    and <tt>DEDENT</tt> mark an end of line, the beginning of a new
    indentation block, and its end, respectively.

    <p>

    Logical annotations are inserted in special comments starting
    with <tt>//@</tt> or <tt>/*@</tt>. In the following grammar, we
    only use the former kind, for simplicity, but both kinds are allowed.

<pre>
      file ::= decl*
      decl ::= py-import | py-function | stmt | logic-declaration
 py-import ::= "from" ident "import" ident { "," ident } NEWLINE
</pre>

Directives <tt>import</tt> are ignored during the translation to
Why3. They are allowed anyway, such that a Python source code using
functions such as <tt>randint</tt> is accepted by a Python
interpreter (see below).

<h4>Function definition</h4>

<pre>
py-function ::= "def" ident "(" [ params ] ")" ":" NEWLINE INDENT { spec } { stmt } DEDENT
     params ::= ident { "," ident }
</pre>

<h4>Function specification</h4>

<pre>
   spec ::= "requires" term NEWLINE
          | "ensures"  term NEWLINE
          | "variant"  term { "," term } NEWLINE
</pre>

<h4>Python expression</h4>

<pre>
  expr ::= "None" | "True" | "False" | integer-literal | string-literal
	 | identifier
	 | identifier "[" expr "]"
	 | "-" expr | "not" expr
	 | expr ( "+" | "-" | "*" | "//" | "%" | "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "and" | "or" ) expr
	 | identifier "(" [ expr { "," expr } ] ")"
	 | "[" [ expr { "," expr } ] "]"
	 | "(" expr ")"
</pre>

<h4>Python statement</h4>

<pre>
       stmt ::= simple_stmt NEWLINE
              | "if" expr ":" suite else_branch
	      | "while" expr ":" loop_body
	      | "for" ident "in" expr ":" loop_body
else_branch ::= /* nothing */
              | "else:" suite
              | "elif" expr ":" suite else_branch
      suite ::= simple_stmt NEWLINE
              | NEWLINE INDENT stmt { stmt } DEDENT
simple_stmt ::= expr
              | "return" expr
              | identifier "=" expr
              | identifier "[" expr "]" "=" expr
              | "break"
	      | "//@" "label" identifier
	      | "//@" ( "assert" | "assume" | "check" ) term
   assignop ::= "=" | "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/="
  loop_body ::= simple_stmt NEWLINE
              | NEWLINE INDENT { loop_annot } stmt { stmt } DEDENT
 loop_annot ::= "//@" "invariant" term NEWLINE
              | "//@" "variant" term { "," term } NEWLINE
</pre>

<h4>Logic declaration</h4>

<pre>
  logic-declaration ::= "//@" "function" "int" identifier "(" params ")" NEWLINE
		      | "//@" "predicate" identifier "(" params ")" NEWLINE
</pre>

Note that logic functions and predicates cannot be given definitions.
Yet, they can be axiomatized, using toplevel <tt>assume</tt> statements.


<h4>Logical term</h4>

<pre>
  term ::= identifier
	 | integer-literal
         | "None"
	 | "True"
	 | "False"
	 | "(" term ")"
	 | term "[" term "]"
	 | term "[" term "<-" term "]"
	 | "not" term
	 | "old" "(" term ")"
	 | "at" "(" term "," identifier ")"
	 | "-" term
	 | term ( "->" | "<->" | "or" | "and" ) term
	 | term ( "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" ) term
	 | term ( "+" | "-" | "*" | "//" | "% ) term
	 | "if" term "then" term "else term
	 | "let" identifier "=" term "in" term
	 | ( "forall" | "exists" ) ident { "," ident } "." term
	 | identifier "(" [ term { "," term } ] ")"
</pre>

    <h2>Built-in functions and predicates</h2>

    <h4>Python code</h4>

    <ul>
      <li> <tt>len(l)</tt>, the length of list <tt>l</tt>
      <li> <tt>int(input())</tt>, reads an integer from standard input
      <li> <tt>range(l, u)</tt>, returns the list of integers
        from <tt>l</tt> inclusive to <tt>u</tt> exclusive <br>
        (in particular, <tt>for x in range(l, u):</tt> is supported)
      <li> <tt>randint(l, u)</tt>, returns a pseudo-random integer
        in the range <tt>l</tt> to <tt>u</tt> inclusive
    </ul>

    <h4>Logic</h4>

    <ul>
      <li> <tt>len(l)</tt>, the length of list <tt>l</tt>
      <li> <tt>occurrence(v, l)</tt>, the number of
	occurrences of the value <tt>v</tt> in list <tt>l</tt>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>

    Python lists are modeled as arrays, whose size cannot be modified.

    <h2>Verifying a program</h2>

    <p>
    Click on the gears button to launch the verification.
    Verification conditions (VCs) then appear in the right panel, in
    the Task List tab, and
    Alt-Ergo is run on each of them with a default time limit (that
    can be set in the Settings menu).
    </p>

    <p>
    When a VC is not proved, there are several options:
    <ul>
      <li> use the contextual menu to rerun Alt-Ergo with a larger
      time limit (e.g. 1000 or 5000 steps instead of 100);
      <li> use the contextual menu to split the VC and rerun Alt-Ergo
      on each sub-VC (split and prove);
      <li> use the Task View tab to investigate the problematic VC,
      for wrong or missing elements of specification (precondition,
      postcondition, invariant);
      <li> add intermediate assertions in the code, using <tt>//@
      assert ...;</tt>.
    </ul>
    </p>
