    <h1>Online version of Why3, with Python input format</h1>

    This version of Why3 is intended for teaching purposes.
    Its input format is a tiny subset of Python, called "micro-Python"
    in the following and described below.

    <p>

    Note: the command-line version of Why3 is also supporting this
    input format, for files with suffix <tt>.py</tt>.

    <h2>Syntax of micro-Python</h2>

    Notation: The grammar of micro-C is given below in extended
    Backus-Naur Form, using | for alternation, () for grouping,
    [] for option, and {} for repetition.
    Special symbols <tt>NEWLINE</tt>, <tt>INDENT</tt>,
    and <tt>DEDENT</tt> mark an end of line, the beginning of a new
    indentation block, and its end, respectively.

    <p>

    Logical annotations are inserted in special comments starting
    with <tt>//@</tt> or <tt>/*@</tt>. In the following grammar, we
    only use the former kind, for simplicity, but both kinds are allowed.

<pre>
      file ::= decl*
      decl ::= py-import | py-function | stmt | logic-declaration
 py-import ::= "from" ident "import" ident { "," ident } NEWLINE
</pre>

Directives <tt>import</tt> are ignored during the translation to
Why3. They are allowed anyway, such that a Python source code using
functions such as <tt>randint</tt> is accepted by a Python
interpreter (see below).

<h4>Function definition</h4>

<pre>
py-function ::= "def" ident "(" [ params ] ")" ":" NEWLINE INDENT { spec } { stmt } DEDENT
     params ::= ident { "," ident }
</pre>

<h4>Function specification</h4>

<pre>
   spec ::= "requires" term NEWLINE
          | "ensures"  term NEWLINE
          | "variant"  term { "," term } NEWLINE
</pre>

<h4>Python expression</h4>

<pre>
  expr ::= "None" | "True" | "False" | integer-literal | string-literal
	 | identifier | identifier ( "++" | "--" ) | ( "++" | "--" ) identifier
	 | identifier "[" expr "]"
	 | identifier "[" expr "]" ( "++" | "--")
	 | ( "++" | "--") identifier "[" expr "]"
	 | "-" expr | "!" expr
	 | expr ( "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" | "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "&&" | "||" ) expr
	 | identifier "(" [ expr { "," expr } ] ")"
	 | "scanf" "(" "\"%d\"" "," "&" identifier ")"
	 | "(" expr ")"
</pre>

<h4>C statement</h4>

<pre>
       stmt ::= ";"
	      | "return" expr ";"
	      | "int" identifier ";"
	      | "int" identifier "[" expr "]" ";"
	      | "break" ";"
	      | "if" "(" expr ")" stmt
	      | "if" "(" expr ")" stmt "else" stmt
	      | "while" "(" expr ")" loop_body
	      | "for" "(" expr_stmt ";" expr ";" expr_stmt ")" loop_body
	      | expr_stmt ";"
	      | block
	      | "//@" "label" identifier ";"
	      | "//@" ( "assert" | "assume" | "check" ) term ";"
      block ::= "{" { stmt } "}"
  expr_stmt ::= "int" identifier "=" expr
	      | identifier assignop exor
	      | identifier "[" expr "]" assignop expr
	      | expr
   assignop ::= "=" | "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/="
  loop_body ::= { loop_annot } stmt
              | "{" { loop_annot } { stmt } "}"
 loop_annot ::= "//@" "invariant" term ";"
              | "//@" "variant" term { "," term } ";"
</pre>

Note that the syntax for loop bodies allows the loop annotations to be
placed either before the block or right at the beginning of the block.

<!-- Note: In ANSI C, the variables must be declared at the beginning of -->
<!-- the block. Here, they can be declared anywhere. -->

<h4>Logic declarations</h4>

<pre>
  logic-declaration ::= "//@" "function" "int" identifier "(" params ")" ";"
		      | "//@" "function" "int" identifier "(" params ")" "=" term ";"
		      | "//@" "predicate" identifier "(" params ")" ";"
		      | "//@" "predicate" identifier "(" params ")" "=" term ";"
		      | "//@" "axiom" identifier ":" term ";"
		      | "//@" "lemma" identifier ":" term ";"
		      | "//@" "goal"  identifier ":" term ";"
</pre>

<h4>Logical term</h4>

<pre>
  term ::= identifier
	 | integer-literal
	 | "true"
	 | "false"
	 | "(" term ")"
	 | term "[" term "]"
	 | term "[" term "<-" term "]"
	 | "!" term
	 | "old" "(" term ")"
	 | "at" "(" term "," identifier ")"
	 | "-" term
	 | term ( "->" | "<->" | "||" | "&&" ) term
	 | term ( "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" ) term
	 | term ( "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "% ) term
	 | "if" term "then" term "else term
	 | "let" identifier "=" term "in" term
	 | ( "forall" | "exists" ) binder { "," binder } "." term
	 | identifier "(" [ term { "," term } ] ")"
binder ::= identifier
	 | identifier "[]"
</pre>

    <h2>Built-in functions and predicates</h2>

    <h4>C code</h4>

    <ul>
      <li> <tt>scanf</tt>, with a syntax limited to <tt>scanf("%d", &x)</tt>
      <li> <tt>printf</tt>, limited to <tt>printf(string-literal,
	  expr1, ..., exprn)</tt> and assuming that the string literal
	contains exactly n occurrences of <tt>%d</tt> (not checked by Why3).
      <li> <tt>rand()</tt>, returns a pseudo-random integer in the range 0 to
	<tt>RAND_MAX</tt> inclusive.
    </ul>

    <h4>Logic</h4>

    <ul>
      <li> <tt>int length(int[] a)</tt>, the length of array <tt>a</tt>
      <li> <tt>int occurrence(int v, int[] a)</tt>, the number of
	occurrences of the value <tt>v</tt> in array <tt>a</tt>
    </ul>

    <h2>Verifying a program</h2>

    <p>
    Click on the gears button to launch the verification.
    Verification conditions (VCs) then appear in the right panel, in
    the Task List tab, and
    Alt-Ergo is run on each of them with a default time limit (that
    can be set in the Settings menu).
    </p>

    <p>
    When a VC is not proved, there are several options:
    <ul>
      <li> use the contextual menu to rerun Alt-Ergo with a larger
      time limit (e.g. 1000 or 5000 steps instead of 100);
      <li> use the contextual menu to split the VC and rerun Alt-Ergo
      on each sub-VC (split and prove);
      <li> use the Task View tab to investigate the problematic VC,
      for wrong or missing elements of specification (precondition,
      postcondition, invariant);
      <li> add intermediate assertions in the code, using <tt>//@
      assert ...;</tt>.
    </ul>
    </p>
