(* Dijkstra's "Dutch national flag"

   The following program sorts an array whose elements may have three
   different values, standing for the three colors of the Dutch
   national flag (blue, white, and red).

   Questions:

   1. Prove safety i.e. the absence of array access out of bounds.

   2. Prove termination.

   3. Prove that, after execution, the array is sorted as follows:

           +--------+---------+---------+
           |  blue  |  white  |   red   |
           +--------+---------+---------+

      (using the predicate "monochrome" that is provided).

   4. Show that after execution the array contents is a permutation of its
      initial contents. Use the library predicate "permut_all" to do so
      (the corresponding module ArrayPermut is already imported).

module Flag

  use int.Int
  use ref.Ref
  use array.Array
  use array.ArraySwap
  use array.ArrayPermut

  type color = Blue | White | Red

  predicate monochrome (a: array color) (i: int) (j: int) (c: color) =
    forall k: int. i <= k < j -> a[k]=c

  let dutch_flag (a: array color)
    requires { 0 <= length a }
    ensures  { true }
  =
    let b = ref 0 in
    let i = ref 0 in
    let r = ref (length a) in
    while !i < !r do
      invariant { true }
      match a[!i] with
      | Blue ->
        swap a !b !i;
        b := !b + 1;
        i := !i + 1
      | White ->
        i := !i + 1
      | Red ->
        r := !r - 1;
        swap a !r !i
      end
    done

end
