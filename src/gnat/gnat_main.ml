(* This is the main file of gnatwhy3 *)

(* Gnatwhy3 does the following:
   - it reads a .mlw file that was generated by gnat2why
   - it computes the VCs
   - it runs the selected provers on each VC.
   - it generates a summary of what was proved and not proved in JSON format
 and outputs this JSON format to stdout (for gnat2why to read).

   See gnat_objectives.mli for the notion of objective and goal.

   See gnat_report.mli for the JSON format

   gnat_main can be seen as the "driver" for gnatwhy3. Much of the
   functionality is elsewhere.
   Specifically, this file does:
      - compute the objective that belongs to a goal/VC
      - drive the scheduling of VCs, and handling of results
      - output the messages
