(* This module is the Database for checks and goals. It also deals with the
   better part of scheduling of VCs.

   A check is something to be proved in Ada, say, a range check. A
   check is defined by an explanation (check kind + Ada location). This is the
   Gnat_expl.check type.

   A goal is a VC that will be sent to Alt-Ergo. In general, there will be many
   goals for each check. Each goal has a trace (list of locations).

   This module has the following functionality:
      - It answers queries to get the goals of a check and the
        check of a goal.
      - It supports scheduling by providing a "next" function that will by
      little chunks return all goals associated to a check.
      - It allows registering prover results and keeps track of the status of
        a check.
      - It defines the scheduler and initializes it, and all the goals,
        correctly.

type status =
   | Proved
   | Not_Proved
   | Work_Left
   | Counter_Example
(* These are the possible statuses of a check.
   [Proved] means that all goals of that check are proved.
   [Not_Proved] means that a proof attempt for a goal of the check that
               cannot (or should not) be further simplified has failed.

   In both cases, there is no more work to do, and we can issue a message to
   the user.

   [Work_Left] means that we don't know yet whether the check is proved or
               not, this means that all subgoals were proved up to now or if
               unproved could be further simplified, but there is some work
               left.
   [Counter_Example] means that the check cannot be proved and the
               counterexample should be generated.
