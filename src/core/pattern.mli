      returns a composition of match- and let-terms equivalent
      to [match terms with branches], where every pattern is
      either a constructor applied to a list of variables, or
      a wildcard pattern.

      Raises [NonExhaustive patterns] where [patterns] is the
      list of non-covered patterns. The check is permissive:

      compiled into [match t, tl with x, xl -> ...]. *)
