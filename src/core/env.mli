    and returns the format-specific contents of type ['a] and a set of
    logical theories. References to the library files of the same format
    are resolved via [lib]. If the parsed file is itself a part of
    the library, the argument [path] contains the fully qualified
    library name of the file, which can be put in the identifiers.
    The string argument [file] indicates the origin of the stream
    (e.g. file name) to be used in error messages. *)

val register_format :

(** [register_format fname exts read] registers a new format [fname]
    for files with extensions from the string list [exts] (without
    the separating dot); [read] is the function to perform parsing.
    Returns a function that maps an environment to a format-specific
    library inside it.

(** [read_lib_theory lib path th] returns the theory [path.th]
    from the library. This is the same as [read_theory] above,
    but the format is determined by [lib] and not by the extra
    [format] parameter.

    @raise TheoryNotFound if the theory was not found in the file *)

val locate_lib_file : env -> fformat -> pathname -> filename
(** [locate_lib_file env format path] finds a library file in a given
    environment, knowing its format and its library path

    This is a low-level function that allows to accees a library file
    without parsing it. Do not use it without a good reason to do.

    @raise LibFileNotFound [path] if the library file was not found
    @raise UnknownFormat [format] if the format is not registered *)
