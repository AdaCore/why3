(* Two Way Sort

   The following program sorts an array of Boolean values, with False<True.

   Questions:

   1. Prove safety i.e. the absence of array access out of bounds.

   2. Prove termination.

   3. Prove that array a is sorted after execution of function two_way_sort
      (using the predicate sorted that is provided).

   4. Show that after execution the array contents is a permutation of its
      initial contents. Use the library predicate "permut_all" to do so
      (the corresponding module ArrayPermut is already imported).

      Within a postcondition, you can refer to the contents of array a
      at the beginning of the function with notation (old a).
      Within a loop invariant, you can refer to it with notation (at a 'Init).

module TwoWaySort

  use import int.Int
  use import bool.Bool
  use import ref.Refint
  use import array.Array
  use import array.ArraySwap
  use import array.ArrayPermut

  predicate (<<) (x y: bool) = x = False \/ y = True

  predicate sorted (a: array bool) =
    forall i1 i2: int. 0 <= i1 <= i2 < a.length -> a[i1] << a[i2]

  let two_way_sort (a: array bool) : unit
  requires { length a >= 0 }
    writes { a }
    ensures { sorted a }
  =
    let i = ref 0 in
    let j = ref (length a - 1) in
    while !i < !j do
	variant { !j - !i }
      invariant { forall k:int. 0 <= k < !i -> not a[k] }
      invariant { forall k:int. !j < k < length a -> a[k] }
      if not a[!i] then
         i := !i + 1
      else if a[!j] then
        j := !j - 1
      else begin
        swap a !i !j;
        i := !i + 1;
        j := !j - 1
      end
    done
