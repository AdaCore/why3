Continuous integration is run inside Docker containers. The corresponding
Docker image is loaded from the Gitlab registry. It is built from the
`misc/Dockerfile.build` description. Changes to this file do not automatically
lead to a new Docker image. One should first modify the image name in the
`BUILD_IMAGE` variable of `.gitlab-ci.yml` and then manually trigger a pipeline
while setting the `NEW_BUILD_IMAGE` variable.
