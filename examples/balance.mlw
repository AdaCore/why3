module Roberval

  use export int.Int
  use export ref.Refint

  type outcome = Left | Equal | Right
    (** the side of the heaviest mass i.e. where the balance leans *)

  val ghost counter: ref int
   (** how many times can we use the balance *)

  val balance (left right: int) : outcome
    requires { !counter > 0 }
    ensures  { match result with
               | Left  -> left > right
               | Equal -> left = right

(** You are given 8 balls and a Roberval balance.
    All balls have the same weight, apart from one, which is lighter.
    Using the balance at most twice, determine the lighter ball.

    Though this problem is not that difficult (though, you may want to
    think about it before reading any further), it is an interesting
    exercise in program specification.

    The index of the lighter ball is passed as a ghost argument to the
    program. Thus it cannot be used to compute the answer, but only to
    write the specification.

    most three times.
