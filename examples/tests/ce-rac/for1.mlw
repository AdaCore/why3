counterexamle: x = 0, i = 2
It is a true counterexample because the underspecification (weak loop invariant wrt postcondition);
If the program is interpreted (w. rac) from the initial state, it does not fail,
because it doesn't reach an iteration where x = 0 and i = 2.
If we execute the iteration where x = 0 and i = 2, then the loop condition will be false
and the post condition will fail -- we can conclude that the program is underspecified.
