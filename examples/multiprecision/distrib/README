===

- library compatible with GMP with 64-bit limbs
- all function names are prefixed by w, e.g., wmpn_add
- for documentation, see https://gmplib.org/manual/Low_002dlevel-Functions.html
- C files are generated from verified WhyML files,
  see https://gitlab.inria.fr/why3/why3/tree/master/examples/multiprecision
- implemented algorithms: ...
- performances comparable to Mini-GMP, if not better;
  twice as slow as GMP with hand-coded assembly;
  even slower on large inputs
