WMP
===

wmp is a formally verified arbitrary-precision library.  It is
compatible with GMP's mpn layer, and implements a subset of the
functions found at
https://gmplib.org/manual/Low_002dlevel-Functions.html (which also
serves as documentation). The function names are prefixed by the
letter w, e.g. wmpn_add. wmp uses 64-bit limbs and 32-bit sizes.

The proofs assume that the source operands (of type wmpn_srcptr) are
entirely separated from the destination operands. This is a departure
from GMP, which allows them to be either equal or separated. When they
are equal, you should use the *_in_place versions instead. In
practice, using the baseline versions should work even in place, but
this fact is not formally verified.

The C files are generated using the Why3 platform. The algorithms were
reimplemented and verified in WhyML (see
https://gitlab.inria.fr/why3/why3/tree/master/examples/multiprecision),
and extracted to C.

The implemented algorithms are addition, subtraction, multiplication
(basecase and Toom-2), division, logical shifts and square root. A
more complete list of exported functions can be found in the header
wmpn.h.

For operands under about 1000 bits, the performances are comparable to
GMP's standalone version, mini-gmp, and about twice as slow as GMP
with hand-coded assembly. For multiplication, this comparison holds
until about 100000 bits. Above those thresholds, GMP uses
asymptotically faster algorithms that we have not implemented, so the
gap widens.
