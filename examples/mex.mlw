(** {1 Minimum excludant, aka mex}

   Author: Jean-Christophe Filliâtre (CNRS)

   Given a finite set of integers, find the smallest nonnegative integer
   that does not belong to this set.

   In the following, the set is given as an array A.
   If N is the size of this array, it is clear that we have 0 <= mex <= N
   for we cannot have the N+1 first natural numbers in the N cells of
   array A (pigeon hole principle).

   A simple algorithm is thus to mark values that belong to [0..N[ in
   some external Boolean array of length N, ignoring any value that is
   negative or greater or equal than N. Then a second loop scans the
   marks until we find some unused value. If don't find any, then it means
   that A contains exactly the integers 0,...,N-1 and the answer is N.

   The very last step in this reasoning requires to invoke the pigeon hole
   principle (imported from the standard library).

   Time O(N) and space O(N).

  In this second implementation, we assume we are free to mutate array A.

  The idea is then to scan the array from left to right, while
  swapping elements to put any value in 0..N-1 at its place in the
  array.  When we are done, a second loop looks for the mex, advancing
  as long as a[i]=i holds.

  Since we perform only swaps, it is obvious that the mex of the final
  array is equal to the mex of the original array.

  Time O(N) and space O(1). The argument for a linear time complexity is as
  follows: whenever we do not advance, we swap the element to its place,
  which is further and did not contain that element; so we can do this only
  N times.

  Surprinsingly, proving that N is the answer whenever array A contains a
  permutation of 0..N-1 is now easy (no need for a pigeon hole
  principle or any kind of proof by induction).
