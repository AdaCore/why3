    Author: Martin Clochard

    This file describe types for values equiped with keys, a priori in the
    purpose of identification. It is mostly intended to factor the
    representations for sets/map-like structures, as it can be used
    both for elements and key-value pairs. *)

(** {2 Keyed type.} *)
module KeyType

  type t 'a
  type key
  val function key (t:t 'a) : key

end
