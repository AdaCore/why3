This is a very simple testsuite.

1) How to run the testsuite

  Run the following command:

  $ ./run-tests.py

2) How to write a test

  Create a new .mlw file or add a new function to an existing one.
  The function should be preceded by a comment of the form

(* RESULT *)

  where RESULT is one of "Valid" or "Unknown" (no quotes). There should be no
  spaces at the beginning of the line, nor at the end.

3) How to add the test to the testsuite

  Edit "run-tests.py" and add the file to the variable "list_of_files" at the
  beginning of the script.
