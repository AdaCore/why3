The result of this bench can be reproduce using Why3 in the following way:

- You need for that purpose to configure and install why3.
- After that you should run why3config and set in ~/.why.conf in the
  section [main] the variable "running_provers_max" to your own
  number of core.
- Run ./run_bench.sh  (it takes 10 hours with 7 core). It creates four files :
partial_deco.csv twin_deco.csv partial_explicit.csv  twin_explicit.csv
- Run ./compute_result.sh (it takes 10seconds) to compute the
  differences between the four transformations. It needs csvtool.
