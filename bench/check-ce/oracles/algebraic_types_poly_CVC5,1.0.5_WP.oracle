Sorry, we don't have a good counterexample for you :(

The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File algebraic_types_poly.mlw:
  Line 29:
    l = (Cons (Integer 0) Nil)
    l = (Cons (Integer 0) Nil)
    Execution of main function `proj_test` with env:
      l = (Cons (Integer 0) Nil)
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 30:
    Property failure at postcondition of `proj_test` with:
      result = 0
