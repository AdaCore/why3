Sub-goal Precondition of goal not_valid'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (19753 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File map_of_algebraic.mlw:
  Line 33:
    m = {block_size= fun (x:int) -> (0:t);
         mem_access_address= fun (x:int) -> Freeable}
    x = {base_addr= 0; offset= (0:t)}
    m = {block_size= fun (x:int) -> (0:t);
         mem_access_address= fun (x:int) -> Freeable}
    x = {base_addr= 0; offset= (0:t)}
    Execution of main function `not_valid` with env:
      m = {block_size= fun (x:int) -> (0:t);
           mem_access_address= fun (x:int) -> Freeable}
      x = {base_addr= 0; offset= (0:t)}
      zero = 0
      one = 1

    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `load_val`
      m = {block_size= fun (x:int) -> (0:t);
           mem_access_address= fun (x:int) -> Freeable}
      x = {base_addr= 0; offset= (0:t)}
    Property failure at precondition of `load_val` with:
