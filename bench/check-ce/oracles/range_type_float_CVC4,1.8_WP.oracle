Sub-goal Assertion of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (285 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File range_type_float.mlw:
  Line 8:
    x = epsilon x:t. t'real x = 10.0
    x = epsilon x:t. t'real x = 10.0
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      x = epsilon x:t. t'real x = 10.0
  Line 10:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      x = epsilon x:t. t'real x = 10.0
