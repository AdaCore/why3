Sub-goal Assertion of goal f1'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (259 steps).
The contracts of some function or loop are too weak, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File func_call5_mono.mlw:
  Line 12:
    x = 1
    x = 1
    Execution of main function `f1` with env:
      x = 1
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 15:
    Giant-step execution of function `g1` with args:
      y = 1
    result of `g1` = {c= 2}
  Line 16:
