Sub-goal Assertion of goal test1'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (237 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File test_result_ce_value1.mlw:
  Line 8:
    x = (- 1)
    x = (- 1)
    Execution of main function `test1` with env:
      x = (- 1)
      zero = 0
      one = 1
