Sub-goal Assertion of goal main'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:

    zero = 0

    Constant one initialization
    one = 1

Sub-goal Assertion of goal main'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, or the contracts of

  execution:
