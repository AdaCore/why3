Sub-goal Postcondition of goal incr'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (231 steps).
The contracts of some function or loop are too weak, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File multifile1.mlw:
  Line 9:
    x = 0
    x = 0
    Execution of main function `incr` with env:
      x = 0
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 11:
    Giant-step execution of function `decr` with args:
      x = 0
    result of `decr` = (- 2)
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
      _ = (- 2)
      _ = 2
  Line 10:
    Property failure at postcondition of `incr` with:
      x = 0
      result = 0
