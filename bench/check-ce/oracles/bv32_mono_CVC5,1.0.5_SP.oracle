Sub-goal Postcondition of goal dummy_update'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (218 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File bv32_mono.mlw:
  Line 9:
    r = {c= (34:t)}
    r = {c= (34:t)}
    Execution of main function `dummy_update` with env:
      r = {c= (34:t)}
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 13:
    Normal execution of function `c` with args:
      arg = {c= 66}
    Normal execution of function `c` with args:
      arg = {c= 66}
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `add`
      v1 = 66
      v2 = 66
    result of `add` = (132:t)
  Line 11:
    Property failure at postcondition of `dummy_update` with:
      r = {c= (132:t)}

Sorry, we don't have a good counterexample for you :(
