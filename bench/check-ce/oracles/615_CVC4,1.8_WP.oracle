Sub-goal Check of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File 615.mlw:
  Line 2:
    t = 0
    x = (- 1)
    t = 0
    x = (- 1)
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      t = 0
      x = (- 1)
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 3:
    Property failure at check with:
