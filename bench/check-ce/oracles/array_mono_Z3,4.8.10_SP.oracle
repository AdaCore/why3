Sub-goal Index in array bounds of goal f1'vc.
Prover result is: Step limit exceeded (3000020 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:

    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1

  Line 35:
    a = {elts= fun (x:int) -> 0; length= 0}
    a = {elts= fun (x:int) -> 0; length= 0}
    Execution of main function `f1` with env:
      a = {elts= fun (x:int) -> 0; length= 0}
      zero = 0
      one = 1
