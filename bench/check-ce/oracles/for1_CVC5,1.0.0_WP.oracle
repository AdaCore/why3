Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (0.03s, 6260 steps).
The contracts of some function or loop are too weak, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
Unknown location:
    _ = ()
File for1.mlw:
  Line 3:
    _ = ()
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      _ = ()
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 5:
    Giant-step execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    result of `ref` = {contents= 0}
  Line 6:
    Giant-step iteration of loop
    x = {contents= 0}
    i = 2
  Line 10:
    Normal execution of function `contents` with args:
      arg = {contents= 0}
  Line 4:
    Property failure at postcondition of `f` with:
      result = 0
