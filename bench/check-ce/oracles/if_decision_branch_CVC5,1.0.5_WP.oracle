Sub-goal Postcondition of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (261 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:

    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File if_decision_branch.mlw:

    Constant path_selector initialization

    result = {sel_path= false}
    path_selector = {sel_path= false}
  Line 18:
    a = 5
    a = 5
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      path_selector = {sel_path= false}
