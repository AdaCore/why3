File "bench/check-ce/recursive_model.mlw", line 11, characters 21-26:
Sub-goal Assertion of goal test'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown or time/memory/step limit.
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File recursive_model.mlw:
  Line 6:
    global = (S Z)
  Line 8:
    i = 2
    i = 2
    Execution of main function `test` with env:
      global = (S Z)
      i = 2
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 10:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      Z = UNDEFINED
      global = (S Z)
      i = 2
