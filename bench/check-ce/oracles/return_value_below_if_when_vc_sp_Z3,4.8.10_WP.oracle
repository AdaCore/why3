File "bench/check-ce/return_value_below_if_when_vc_sp.mlw", line 7, characters 12-65:
Sub-goal Postcondition of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File return_value_below_if_when_vc_sp.mlw:
  Line 6:
    b = true
    y = 42
    b = true
    y = 42
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      b = true
      y = 42
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 8:
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `bool_neq`
      x = 42
      y = 0
    result of `bool_neq` = true
  Line 7:
    Property failure at postcondition of `f` with:
      True = UNDEFINED
      b = true
      y = 42
      result = true
