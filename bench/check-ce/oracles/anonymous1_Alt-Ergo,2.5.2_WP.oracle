Sub-goal Assertion of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (7 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File anonymous1.mlw:
  Line 4:
    x = 0
    x = 0
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      x = 0
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 5:
    Normal execution of function `h` with args:
      y = 0
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
      _ = 0
      _ = 2
  Line 6:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      x = 0
      w = 2
