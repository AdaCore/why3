Sub-goal Assertion of goal f1'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (40 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File log-simple.mlw:
  Line 10:
    a = 0
  Line 12:
    b = {contents= 43}
  Line 14:
    x = 0
    y = {contents= 0}
    x = 0
    y = {contents= 0}
    Execution of main function `f1` with env:
      a = 0
      b = {contents= 43}
      x = 0
      y = {contents= 0}
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 16:
    Normal execution of function `contents` with args:
      arg = {contents= 0}
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
