Sub-goal Postcondition of goal main_f'vc.

Sub-goal Postcondition of goal main_g'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (822 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File val_function.mlw:
  Line 15:
    y = 42
    y = 42
    Execution of main function `main_g` with env:
      y = 42
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 18:
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `g`
      x = 42
    result of `g` = 43
  Line 19:
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
      _ = 43
      _ = 1
  Line 16:
    Property failure at postcondition of `main_g` with:
      result = 44
