Sub-goal Assertion of goal f2'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (0.03s, 6359 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1

    x = 0
    x = 0
    Execution of main function `f2` with env:
      x = 0
      zero = 0
      one = 1
