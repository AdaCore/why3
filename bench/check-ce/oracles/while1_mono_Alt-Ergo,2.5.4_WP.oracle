Sub-goal Postcondition of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (16 steps).
The contracts of the following functions/loops are too weak :
  - Loop at "bench/check-ce/while1_mono.mlw", line 10, character 4 to line 15, character 8
, for example during the following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
Unknown location:
    _ = ()
File while1_mono.mlw:
  Line 6:
    _ = ()
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      _ = ()
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 8:
    Normal execution of function `t'mk` with args:
      c = 0
  Line 9:
    Normal execution of function `t'mk` with args:
      c = 0
  Line 10:
    Giant-step iteration of loop
    x = {c= 0}
    i = {c= 3}
    Normal execution of function `c` with args:

    Normal execution of function `(<)` with args:

  Line 16:
