Sub-goal Precondition of goal ok'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (110592 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File bv32_toBig.mlw:
  Line 8:
    i = (8:t)
    i = (8:t)
    Execution of main function `ok` with env:
      i = (8:t)
      zero = 0
      one = 1
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `toBig`
