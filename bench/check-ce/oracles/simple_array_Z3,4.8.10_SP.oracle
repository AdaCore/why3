Goal t1.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (147 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File simple_array.mlw:
  Line 5:
    t = fun (x!04:int) -> if x!04 = 0 then 3 else 2
    i = 0
    t = fun (x!04:int) -> if x!04 = 0 then 3 else 2
    i = 0
    Execution of main function `t1'goal` with env:
      i = 0
      t = fun (x!04:int) -> if x!04 = 0 then 3 else 2
Unknown location:
    Normal execution of function `Tuple0` with args:
File simple_array.mlw:
  Line 6:
    Property failure at postcondition of `t1'goal` with:
      i = 0
      t = fun (x!04:int) -> if x!04 = 0 then 3 else 2
