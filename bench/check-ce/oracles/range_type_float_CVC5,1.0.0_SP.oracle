<check-ce-categorization>Categorizations of models:
- Selected model 0: INCOMPLETE
  - Concrete RAC: INCOMPLETE (terminated because cannot import value from model: not implemented for value 10.0)

- Checked model 1: INCOMPLETE
  - Concrete RAC: INCOMPLETE (terminated because Assertion cannot be evaluated)
