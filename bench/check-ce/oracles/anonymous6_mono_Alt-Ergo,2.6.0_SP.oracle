, for example during the following execution:

    one = 1
Unknown location:

    Execution of main function `f` with env:

      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 8:
    Normal execution of function `t'mk` with args:
      c = 0
  Line 9:
    Giant-step execution of anonymous function with args:
      z = {c= 0}

    result = ()
  Line 10:
    Property failure at assertion with:
