<check_ce:categorization>Categorizations of models:
- Checked model 0: INCOMPLETE
  - Concrete RAC: INCOMPLETE (terminated because many args for exec fun)
  - Abstract RAC: INCOMPLETE (terminated because Postcondition of `f` cannot be evaluated)
- Selected model 1: INCOMPLETE
  - Concrete RAC: INCOMPLETE (terminated because many args for exec fun)
  - Abstract RAC: INCOMPLETE (terminated because Postcondition of `f` cannot be evaluated)
