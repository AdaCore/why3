Sub-goal Assertion of goal g2'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (99 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File model_projection2.mlw:
  Line 11:
    to_array = fun (bOUND_VARIABLE_3991:poly_map int int) -> fun (x:int) -> 0
  Line 15:
    get = fun (_arg_12:poly_map int int) (_arg_22:int) -> 41
  Line 22:
    x = UNDEFINED
    x = UNDEFINED
    Execution of main function `g2` with env:
