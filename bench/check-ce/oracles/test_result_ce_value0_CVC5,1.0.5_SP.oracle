File "bench/check-ce/test_result_ce_value0.mlw", line 8, characters 11-18:
Sub-goal Assertion of goal test2'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (138 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File test_result_ce_value0.mlw:
  Line 6:
    x = 0
    x = 0
    Execution of main function `test2` with env:
      x = 0
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 7:
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `id`
      x = 0
    result of `id` = 42
  Line 8:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      a = 42
