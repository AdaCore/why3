Goal wrong.
Prover result is: Unknown or time/memory/step limit.
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File 640_no_loc_failure.mlw:
  Line 5:
    x = (42:t)
  Line 4:
    x = (42:t)
    Execution of main function `wrong'goal` with env:
      x = (42:t)
      zero = 0
      one = 1
Unknown location:
    Normal execution of function `Tuple0` with args:
File 640_no_loc_failure.mlw:
  Line 5:
    Property failure at postcondition of `wrong'goal` with:
      x = (42:t)

Sorry, we don't have a good counterexample for you :(
