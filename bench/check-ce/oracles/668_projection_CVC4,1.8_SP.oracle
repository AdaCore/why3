Sub-goal Postcondition of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (19750 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File 668_projection.mlw:
  Line 12:
    n = epsilon x:t. t'int x = (- 1)
    min = epsilon x:t. t'int x = 0
    n = epsilon x:t. t'int x = (- 1)
    min = epsilon x:t. t'int x = 0
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      n = epsilon x:t. t'int x = (- 1)
      min = epsilon x:t. t'int x = 0
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 13:
    Property failure at postcondition of `f` with:
      min = epsilon x:t. t'int x = 0
      result = epsilon x:t. t'int x = (- 1)

Sorry, we don't have a good counterexample for you :(
