Goal wrong.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (1097 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File 640_no_loc_failure.mlw:
  Line 5:
    x = (4611686018427387904:t)
  Line 4:
    x = (4611686018427387904:t)
    Execution of main function `wrong'goal` with env:
      x = (4611686018427387904:t)
      zero = 0
      one = 1

    Property failure at postcondition of `wrong'goal` with:
