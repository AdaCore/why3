Sub-goal Assertion of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat).
The contracts of some function or loop are too weak, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
Unknown location:
    _ = ()
File anonymous6_mono.mlw:
  Line 7:
    _ = ()
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      _ = ()
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 8:
    Normal execution of function `t'mk` with args:
      c = 0
  Line 9:
    Giant-step execution of anonymous function with args:
      z = {c= 0}
    z = {c= 3}
    result = ()
  Line 10:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      z = {c= 3}
