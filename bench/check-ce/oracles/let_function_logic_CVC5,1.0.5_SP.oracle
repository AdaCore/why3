Sub-goal Postcondition of goal main'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (327 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File let_function_logic.mlw:
  Line 3:
    g = fun ($x11:int) -> if $x11 = 42 then 43 else (- 1)
  Line 11:
    y = 42
    y = 42
    Execution of main function `main` with env:
      g = fun ($x11:int) -> if $x11 = 42 then 43 else (- 1)
      y = 42
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 14:
    Normal execution of function `f` with args:
      x = 42
  Line 9:
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
      _ = 42
      _ = 1
  Line 15:
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:

  Line 12:
    Property failure at postcondition of `main` with:
      result = 44
