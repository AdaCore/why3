Sub-goal Index in array bounds of goal f1'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (1622 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File array_poly.mlw:
  Line 7:
    a = []
    a = []
    Execution of main function `f1` with env:
      a = []
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 8:
    Normal execution of function `([])` with args:
      a = []
      i = 0
    Property failure at precondition of `([])` with:
      a = []
      i = 0
