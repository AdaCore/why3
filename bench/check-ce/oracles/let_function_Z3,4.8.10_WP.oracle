Sub-goal Postcondition of goal main_f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (273 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File let_function.mlw:
  Line 5:
    y = 42
    y = 42
    Execution of main function `main_f` with env:
      y = 42
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 8:
    Normal execution of function `f` with args:
      x = 42
  Line 3:
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
      _ = 42
      _ = 1
  Line 9:
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
      _ = 43
      _ = 1
  Line 6:
    Property failure at postcondition of `main_f` with:
      result = 44
