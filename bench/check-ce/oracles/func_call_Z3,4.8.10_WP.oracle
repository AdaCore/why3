Sub-goal Assertion of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Step limit exceeded (0.36s, 3000045 steps).
The contracts of some function or loop are too weak, for example during the
  following execution:

    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File func_call.mlw:

    Constant z initialization
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function with args:
    result = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref'mk` with args:

    z = {contents= 0}
Unknown location:
    _ = ()
