Sub-goal Postcondition of goal g'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (12 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File func_call3.mlw:
  Line 4:
    Constant z initialization
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function with args:
    result = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref'mk` with args:
      contents = 0
    z = {contents= 0}
  Line 6:
    x = 0
    x = 0
    Execution of main function `g` with env:

      x = 0
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 10:
