, for example during the following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
Unknown location:
    _ = ()
File anonymous6.mlw:
  Line 4:
    _ = ()
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      _ = ()
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 5:
    Giant-step execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    result of `ref` = {contents= 0}
  Line 6:
    Giant-step execution of anonymous function with args:
      z = {contents= 0}
    z = {contents= 3}
    result = ()
  Line 7:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      z = {contents= 3}
