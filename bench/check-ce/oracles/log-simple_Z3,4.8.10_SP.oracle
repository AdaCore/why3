Sub-goal Assertion of goal f1'vc.
Prover result is: Step limit exceeded (3000062 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1

    b = {contents= 0}
  Line 14:
    x = 0
    y = {contents= 0}
    x = 0
    y = {contents= 0}
    Execution of main function `f1` with env:
      a = 43
