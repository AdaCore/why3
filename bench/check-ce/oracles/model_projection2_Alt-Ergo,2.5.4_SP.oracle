Sub-goal Assertion of goal g2'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (1 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1

    get = fun (arg_011:poly_map int int) (arg_18:int) -> 42
  Line 25:
    x = UNDEFINED
    x = UNDEFINED
    Execution of main function `g2` with env:
      get = fun (arg_011:poly_map int int) (arg_18:int) -> 42
      x = UNDEFINED
      zero = 0
