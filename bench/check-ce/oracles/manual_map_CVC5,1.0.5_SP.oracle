Sub-goal Postcondition of goal test_map'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (186 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File manual_map.mlw:
  Line 4:
    x = fun (x:int) -> if x = 1 then 3 else 0
    x = fun (x:int) -> if x = 1 then 3 else 0
    Execution of main function `test_map` with env:
      x = fun (x:int) -> if x = 1 then 3 else 0
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 7:
    Normal execution of function `set` with args:
      f = fun (x:int) -> if x = 1 then 3 else 0
      x = 0
      v = 3
  Line 5:
    Property failure at postcondition of `test_map` with:
      result = (fun y -> if pure { if y = x then True else False } then v
                  else f y) with f = fun (x1:int) -> if x1 = 1 then 3 else 0, x = 0, v = 3
