Sub-goal Assertion of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat).
The contracts of some function or loop are too weak, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File anonymous2.mlw:
  Line 3:
    Constant z initialization
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function with args:
    result = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref'mk` with args:
      contents = 0
    z = {contents= 0}
  Line 5:
    x = 1
    x = 1
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      z = {contents= 0}
      x = 1
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 8:
    Giant-step execution of function `h` with args:
      y = 1
    z = {contents= 0}
    result of `h` = ()
  Line 9:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      z = {contents= 0}
