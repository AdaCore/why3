File "bench/check-ce/range_type_int.mlw", line 9, characters 12-27:
Sub-goal Assertion of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (1 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File range_type_int.mlw:
  Line 7:
    x = epsilon x:int32. int32'int x = 6
    x = epsilon x:int32. int32'int x = 6
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      x = epsilon x:int32. int32'int x = 6
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 9:
    Property failure at assertion with:
      x = epsilon x:int32. int32'int x = 6
