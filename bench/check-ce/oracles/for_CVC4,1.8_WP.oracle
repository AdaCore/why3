Sub-goal Loop invariant preservation of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown or time/memory/step limit.
The contracts of some function or loop are too weak, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
Unknown location:
    _ = ()
File for.mlw:
  Line 4:
    _ = ()
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      _ = ()
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 5:
    Giant-step execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    result of `ref` = {contents= 0}
  Line 6:
    Giant-step execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    result of `ref` = {contents= 0}
  Line 7:
    Giant-step iteration of loop
    x1 = {contents= (-1)}
    x2 = {contents= 0}
    i = 0
    Giant-step iteration of loop
  Line 9:
    Normal execution of function `(=)` with args:
      x = 0
      y = 0
  Line 10:
    Normal execution of function `contents` with args:
      arg = {contents= (-1)}
    Normal execution of function `(+)` with args:
      _ = (-1)
      _ = 1
  Line 8:
    Property failure at loop invariant preservation with:
      x1 = {contents= 0}
      i = 1
