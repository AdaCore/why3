Sub-goal Postcondition of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File double_projection.mlw:
  Line 8:
    d = fun (x!0:t) -> 0
  Line 12:
    c = fun (x!0:t) -> 1
  Line 17:
    x = epsilon x:t. d x = 0 /\ c x = 1
    x = epsilon x:t. d x = 0 /\ c x = 1
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      d = fun (x!0:t) -> 0
      c = fun (x!0:t) -> 1
      x = epsilon x:t. d x = 0 /\ c x = 1
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 19:
    Property failure at postcondition of `f` with:
      x = epsilon x:t. d x = 0 /\ c x = 1
