Goal t1.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (9 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File simple_array.mlw:
  Line 5:
    t = fun (x:int) -> if x = 0 then 0 else 0
    i = 0
    t = fun (x:int) -> if x = 0 then 0 else 0
    i = 0
    Execution of main function `t1'goal` with env:
      i = 0
      t = fun (x:int) -> if x = 0 then 0 else 0
Unknown location:
    Normal execution of function `Tuple0` with args:
File simple_array.mlw:
  Line 6:
    Property failure at postcondition of `t1'goal1` with:
      i = 0
      t = fun (x:int) -> if x = 0 then 0 else 0
