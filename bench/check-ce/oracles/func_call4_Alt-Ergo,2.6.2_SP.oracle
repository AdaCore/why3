File "bench/check-ce/func_call4.mlw", line 11, characters 25-30:
Sub-goal Assertion of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (15 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File int.mlw:
  Line 13:
    Constant zero initialization
    zero = 0
  Line 14:
    Constant one initialization
    one = 1
File func_call4.mlw:
  Line 4:
    Constant z initialization
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function with args:
    result = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref` with args:
      contents = 0
    Normal execution of function `ref'mk` with args:
      contents = 0
    z = {contents= 0}
Unknown location:
    _ = ()
File func_call4.mlw:
  Line 10:
    _ = ()
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      z = {contents= 0}
      _ = ()
      zero = 0
      one = 1
  Line 11:
    Normal execution of function `Tuple0` with args:
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `g`
      _ = ()
    z = {contents= 2}
    result of `g` = ()
    Property failure at assertion with:
      z = {contents= 2}
