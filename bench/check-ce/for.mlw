counterexamle: x1 = -1 at the beggining of the loop
It is a true counterexample because the underspecification (weak loop invariant);
If the program is interpreted (w. rac) from the initial state, it does not fail,
because it doesn't reach an iteration where x1 = -2.
If the particular iteration given by the counterexample is interpreted, then the
invariant will fail, and we can conclude that the program is underspecified.
