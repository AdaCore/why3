(*
counterexamle: `x1 = -1`, `i = 0` at the beggining of the loop.

The execution of `f` with the counterexample:
- terminates normally if executed concretly;
- terminates in error if executed abstractly (invariant preservation
  fails)

It is a real counterexample due to underspecification (weak loop
invariant).
