Invariant for loop [anonymous_loop_0] is k.contents = 0
Domains for loop [anonymous_loop_0] are k = [0;0]
The generated invariant implies { k = 0 }

Invariant for loop [anonymous_loop_0] is k1.contents = 0
Domains for loop [anonymous_loop_0] are k1 = [0;0]
The generated invariant implies { k = 0 }

Invariant for loop [anonymous_loop_0] is k2.contents = 0
Domains for loop [anonymous_loop_0] are k2 = [0;0]
The generated invariant implies { k = 0 }
