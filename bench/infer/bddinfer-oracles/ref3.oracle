Invariant for loop [anonymous_loop_0] is 0 <= k.contents /\ o = 0
Domains for loop [anonymous_loop_0] are x = ]-oo;+oo[; o = [0;0]; k = [0;+oo[
The generated invariant does not imply { (0 <= k && k < x) }

Invariant for loop [anonymous_loop_0] is 0 <= k1.contents /\ o1 = 0
Domains for loop [anonymous_loop_0] are
  x1 = ]-oo;+oo[; o1 = [0;0]; k1 = [0;+oo[
The generated invariant does not imply { (0 <= k && k < x) }
