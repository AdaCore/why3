Invariant for loop [anonymous_loop_0] is
  if x = True then if y = True then 20 <= t1 else 0 <= t1 /\ t1 <= 19
  else y = False /\ t0 = 0 /\ t1 = 0
Domains for loop [anonymous_loop_0] are
  x = top; y = top; t0 = ]-oo;+oo[; t1 = [0;+oo[
The generated invariant does not imply { (~y || (t0 + t1) >= 50) }
