(* Performed introductions depending on whether counterexamples are
   requested, as said by the meta "get_counterexmp". When this meta
   set, this transformation introduces the model variables that are
   still embedded in the goal. When it is not set, it removes all
   these unused-ce-related variables, even in the context.  *)
