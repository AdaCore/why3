= Roadmap for second release, as early as possible in 2011 =

* fix local installation
** fix local executables names (DONE)

* fix problems with .why.conf
** if we distribute the current state, users who already have a ~/.why.conf
will get a error message because of missing loadpath to modules
     Done? - the magic number will force to not use the old ~/.why.conf of
             the user
** generally speaking, we should rethink the design of that .why.conf: avoid
   absolute paths,
   Partially done - libdir, datadir, loadpath, ... are not written in why.conf
   if they correspond to the default value.
* proof replay
** in IDE: replay all obsolete but previously successful proofs
** in whybench
** add replay of existing proofs in "make bench" to detect regression
** add automatic recompilation, install and bench every night on moloch

* IDE: implement "inline" (use transformation inline_goal)
** partially done
** problem 1: detect that transformation did nothing

* IDE: debug "hide proved goals" feature

* IDE: ajouter "invalid" comme cas de resultats de preuve
  (utiliser call_provers.proof_result dans gmain)

* IDE, file names in DB: use only file names relative to the db file (DONE)



= Roadmap for 2011 =

* WhyML (JC) 
* Jessie3
* traceability
* Coq plugin
* Coq realizations of theories


= Papers to write =

* Encodings and transformations (Andrei+Francois, CADE 2011, deadline January 2011)
* Caml code ?
* logic language for talking to provers
** FOL + poly + alg + ind + rec ? + theories
* VACID-0
* system description (e.g. at CAD, TACAS)
* rapports recherche ?










= Roadmap for December 2010 =

== Mails announcement ==

----------------------- Why-discuss list ---------------------------

We are happy to announce the first public release of Why3, also known
as the Why platform next generation. It is a new project, independent
from Why versions 2.xx.

The home web page of Why3 is http://why3.gforge.inria.fr, where you
can find the source distribution and the manual. See the manual for 
installation instructions and contact information.

The main new features with respect to Why 2.xx are the following.

1) Completely redesigned input syntax for logic declarations

* new syntax for terms and formulas
* enumerated and algebraic data types, pattern matching
* recursive definitions of logic functions and predicates,
  with termination checking
* inductive definitions of predicates
* declarations are structured in components called "theories",
  which can be reused and instantiated

2) More generic handling of goals and lemmas to prove

* concept of proof task
* generic concept of task transformation
* generic approach for communicating with external provers

3) Source code organized as a library with a documented API,
to allow access to Why3 features programmatically.

4) GUI with new features w.r.t. the former GWhy

* session save and restore
* prover calls in parallel
* splitting, and more generally applying task transformations, on demand
* ability to edit proofs for interactive provers (Coq only for the moment) 
  on any subtask

5) Extensible architecture via plugins

* users can define new transformations
* users can add connections to additional provers


Beware that some Why features are not yet available in Why3:

* There is a VC generator distributed in Why3 in an experimental stage
  and intentionally undocumented in the current documentation (the input
  syntax for programs may change a lot in the future).

* There is no front-end for other languages like C or Java. However,
  the last release Why 2.28 is able to use Why3 as a back-end

Notice that Why3 is expected to replace Why2 in the future. As such,
it is the project where improvements and new features will be
implemented. As this is the first public release of Why3, it is likely
that missing features, and possibly bugs, will raise soon. Please
report those in the bug tracker, we will do our best to fix them and
provide new releases in a short time.





--------------------- Frama-C list ----------------------------


The first release of Why3, also known as the Why platform next
generation, is publicly available. Why3 is a new project, independent
from Why. The detailed announcement is attached below.

The Jessie plugin of the Why release 2.28 has the ability to use Why3
as back-end. You must install both Why 2.28 and Why3 for this to work.

Using the Why3 GUI on a C file is done as follows
  frama-c -jessie -jessie-atp why3ide <file>.c
(You can also run it in batch mode using
  frama-c -jessie -jessie-atp why3 <file>.c
and process the generated Why3 file "<file>.jessie/why/<file>_why3.why" 
with Why3 batch tools).

The main new features of interest in the GUI are

* new provers available
* calling provers in parallel
* splitting on demand
* ability to call Coq on a given VC to provide a proof script. Incidentally,
  this feature can be used to analyse the VC to understand why it is
  not proved automatically.  
* proof session saved and restored at startup

Any question, remark or bug report concerning only Why3 should be done
using the Why3 public discussion list and bug tracker.
