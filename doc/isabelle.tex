\subsection{Usage}

\todo{Explain Isabelle/jedit server interaction}

When using Isabelle, files generated from Why3 theories are stored in
a dedicated XML format. Those files should not be edited. Instead,
realizations must be designed in some \texttt{.thy} as follows. 

\subsection{Realizations}

The realization file corresponding to some Why3 file \url{f.why}
should have the following form. 
\begin{verbatim}
theory Why3_f
imports Why3_Setup
begin

section {* realization of theory T *}

why3_open "f/T.xml"

why3_vc <some lemma> 
<proof>

why3_vc <some other lemma> by proof

[...]

why3_end
\end{verbatim}


See directory \url{lib/isabelle} for examples.
