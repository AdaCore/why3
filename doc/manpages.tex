\chapter{Reference Manuals for the \why Tools}
\label{chap:manpages}
%HEVEA\cutname{manpages.html}

This chapter details the usage of each of the command-line tools
provided by the \why environment. The main command is \texttt{why3};
it acts as an entry-point to all the features of \why. It is invoked
as such
\begin{verbatim}
why3 [general options...] <command> [specific options...]
\end{verbatim}

The following commands are available:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{config}] manages the user's configuration,
  including the detection of installed provers.
\item[\texttt{doc}] produces HTML versions of \why source codes.
\item[\texttt{execute}] performs a symbolic execution of \whyml
  input files.
\item[\texttt{extract}] generates an OCaml program corresponding to
  \whyml input files.
\item[\texttt{latex}] print an inductive type definition in LaTeX.
\item[\texttt{ide}] provides a graphical interface to display goals
  and to run provers and transformations on them.
\item[\texttt{prove}] reads \whyml input files and calls
  provers, on the command-line.
\item[\texttt{realize}] generates interactive proof skeletons for
  \why input files.
\item[\texttt{replay}] replays the proofs stored in a session,
  for regression test purposes.
\item[\texttt{session}] dumps various informations from a proof
  session, and possibly modifies the session.
\item[\texttt{wc}] gives some token statistics about \whyml
  source files.
\end{description}

All these commands are also available as standalone executable files,
if needed.

The commands accept a common subset of command-line options. In
particular, option \verb|--help| displays the usage and options.
\begin{description}

\section{The \texttt{config} Command}
\label{sec:why3config}

\why must be configured to access external provers. Typically, this is done
by running the \texttt{config} command.
This must be done each time a new prover is installed.%
\index{config@\texttt{config}}%
\index{configuration file}

The provers that \why attempts to detect are described in
the readable configuration file \texttt{provers-detection-data.conf}
of the \why data directory (\eg
\texttt{/usr/local/share/why3}). Advanced users may try to modify this
file to add support for detection of other provers. (In that case,
please consider submitting a new prover configuration on the bug
tracking system.)

The result of provers detection is stored in the user's
configuration file (\verb+~/.why3.conf+ or, in the case of local
installation, \verb+why3.conf+ in \why sources top directory). This file
is also human-readable, and advanced users may modify it in order to
experiment with different ways of calling provers, \eg different
versions of the same prover, or with different options.

The \texttt{config} command also detects the plugins installed in the \why
plugins directory (\eg \texttt{/usr/local/lib/why3/plugins}). A
plugin must register itself as a parser, a transformation or a
printer, as explained in the corresponding section.
\index{plugin}

If the user's configuration file is already present,
\texttt{config} will only reset unset variables to default value,
but will not try to detect provers.
The option \verb|--detect-provers| should be used to force
\why to detect again the available
provers and to replace them in the configuration file. The option
\verb|--detect-plugins| will do the same for plugins.
\index{detect-provers@\verb+--detect-provers+}
\index{detect-plugins@\verb+--detect-plugins+}

If a supported prover is installed under a name
that is not automatically recognized by \texttt{why3config},
the option \verb|--add-prover| will add a specified binary
to the configuration. For example, an Alt-Ergo executable
\verb|/home/me/bin/alt-ergo-trunk| can be added as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
why3 config --add-prover alt-ergo alt-ergo-trunk /home/me/bin/alt-ergo-trunk
\end{verbatim}
As the first argument, one should put a prover family
identification string. The list of known prover families
can be obtained by the option \verb|--list-prover-families|.
\index{add-prover@\verb+--add-prover+}
\index{list-prover-ids@\verb+--list-prover-families+}

\section{The \texttt{prove} Command}
\label{sec:why3ref}

\why is primarily used to call provers on goals contained in an
input file. By default, such a file must be written in \whyml language
(extension \texttt{.mlw}).
However, a dynamically loaded
plugin can register a parser for some other format of logical problems,
\eg TPTP or SMT-LIB.
\index{prove@\texttt{prove}}

The \texttt{prove} command executes the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parse the command line and report errors if needed.
\item Read the configuration file using the priority defined in
  Section~\ref{sec:whyconffile}.
\item Load the plugins mentioned in the configuration. It will not
  stop if some plugin fails to load.
\item Parse and typecheck the given files using the correct parser in order
  to obtain a set of \why theories for each file. It uses
  the filename extension or the \verb|--format| option to choose
  among the available parsers. \verb|why3 --list-formats| lists
  the registered parsers.
  \index{list-formats@\verb+--list-formats+}
  \whyml modules are turned into
  theories containing verification conditions as goals.
\item Extract the selected goals inside each of the selected theories
  into tasks. The goals and theories are selected using options
  \verb|-G/--goal| and \verb|-T/--theory|. Option
  \verb|-T/--theory| applies to the previous file appearing on the
  command line. Option \verb|-G/--goal| applies to the previous theory
  appearing on the command line. If no theories are selected in a file,
  then every theory is considered as selected. If no goals are selected
  in a theory, then every goal is considered as selected.
  \index{G@\verb+-G+|see{\texttt{-{}-goal}}}
  \index{goal@\verb+--goal+}
  \index{T@\verb+-T+|see{\texttt{-{}-theory}}}
  \index{theory@\verb+--theory+}
\item Apply the transformations requested
  with \verb|-a/--apply-transform| in their order of appearance on the
  command line. \verb|why3 --list-transforms| lists the known
  transformations; plugins can add more of them.
  \index{a@\verb+-a+|see{\texttt{-{}-apply-transform}}}
  \index{apply-transform@\verb+--apply-transform+}
  \index{list-transforms@\verb+--list-transforms+}
\item Apply the driver selected with the \verb|-D/--driver| option,
  or the driver of the prover selected with the \verb|-P/--prover|
  option. \verb|why3 --list-provers| lists the known provers, \ie the ones
  that appear in the configuration file.
  \index{D@\verb+-D+|see{\texttt{-{}-driver}}}
  \index{driver@\verb+--driver+}
  \index{P@\verb+-P+|see{\texttt{-{}-prover}}}
  \index{prover@\verb+--prover+}
  \index{list-provers@\verb+--list-provers+}
\item If option \verb|-P/--prover| is given, call the selected prover
  on each generated task and print the results. If option
  \verb|-D/--driver| is given, print each generated task using
  the format specified in the selected driver.
\end{enumerate}

%\texttt{why3} calls the provers sequentially, use \texttt{why3bench} if *)
%you want to call the provers concurrently.  *)

\subsection{Prover Results}
The provers can give the following output:
\begin{description}
\item[Valid] The goal is proved in the given context.
\item[Unknown] The prover has stopped its search.
\item[Timeout] The prover has reached the time limit.
\item[Failure] An error has occurred.
\item[Invalid] The prover knows the goal cannot be proved.
\end{description}
% \why can also be *)
% used to provide other informations : *)
% \begin{itemize} *)
% \item \texttt{print-namespace} print the namespace of the selected *)
%   theories *)
% \item TO BE COMPLETED *)
% \end{itemize} *)

%Option \verb|--bisect| changes the behavior of why3. With this
%option, \verb|-P/--prover| and \verb|-o/--output| must be given
%and a valid goal must be selected. The last step executed by why3 is
%replaced by computing a minimal set (in the great majority of the
%case) of declarations that still prove the goal. Currently it does not
%use any information provided by the prover; it calls the prover
%multiple times with reduced context. The minimal set of declarations is
%then written in the prover syntax into a file located in the directory
%given to the \verb|-o/--output| option.

\subsection{Additional Options}
\label{sec:proveoptions}

\begin{description}
%\item[\texttt{-{}-get-ce}] activates the generation of a potential
%counter-example when a proof does not succeed (experimental).
\item[\texttt{-{}-extra-expl-prefix \textsl{<s>}}] specifies
  \textsl{s} as an additional prefix for labels that denotes VC
  explanations. The option can be used several times to specify
  several prefixes.
\end{description}

\subsection{Getting Potential Counterexamples}

That feature is presented in details in Section~\ref{sec:idece}, that should be read first.

Counterexamples are also displayed by the \texttt{why3 prove} command
when one selects a prover with the \texttt{counterexamples}
alternative. The output is currently done in a JSON syntax (this may change in the future).

% TODO: see issue #270
% should be better given in human readable syntax by default, and
% turned into JSON syntax only when using a option


\section{The \texttt{ide} Command}
\label{sec:ideref}

The basic usage of the GUI is described by the tutorial of
Section~\ref{sec:gui}. The command-line options are the common options
detailed in introduction to this chapter, plus the specific option
already described for the command \texttt{prove} in
Section~\ref{sec:proveoptions}.
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-{}-extra-expl-prefix \textsl{<s>}}]
\end{description}
At least one anonymous argument must be specified on the command
line. More precisely, the first anonymous argument must be the
directory of the session. If the directory does not exist, it is
created. The other arguments should be existing files that are going
to be added to the session. For convenience, if there is only one
anonymous argument, it can be an existing file and in this case the
session directory is obtained by removing the extension from the file
name.

We describe the actions of the various menus and buttons of the
interface.
\index{ide@\texttt{ide}}

\subsection{Session}
\label{sec:idref:session}
\why stores in a session the way you achieve to prove goals that come
from a file (\texttt{.why}), from weakest-precondition (\texttt{.mlw}) or by other
means. A session stores which file you prove, by applying which
transformations, by using which prover. A proof attempt records the
complete name of a prover (name, version, optional attribute), the
time limit and memory limit given, and the result of the prover. The
result of the prover is the same as when you run the \texttt{prove} command. It
contains the time taken and the state of the proof:

\begin{description}
\item[Valid] The task is valid according to the prover. The
  goal is considered proved.
\item[Invalid] The task is invalid.
\item[Timeout] the prover exceeded the time limit.
\item[OufOfMemory] The prover exceeded the memory limit.
\item[Unknown] The prover cannot determine if the task
  is valid. Some additional information can be provided.
\item[Failure] The prover reported a failure.
\item[HighFailure] An error occurred while trying to call the
  prover, or the prover answer was not understood.
\end{description}

Additionally, a proof attempt can have the following attributes:

\begin{description}
\item[obsolete]\index{obsolete!proof attempt} The prover associated to
  that proof attempt has not been run on the current task, but on an
  earlier version of that task. You need to replay the proof
  attempt, \ie run the prover with the current task of the proof
  attempt, in order to update the answer of the prover and remove this
  attribute.
\item[detached]\index{detached!proof attempt} The proof attempt is not
  associated to a proof task anymore. The reason might be that a proof
  goal disappeared, or that there is a syntax or typing error in the
  current file, that makes all nodes temporarily detached until the
  parsing error is fixed. Detached nodes of the session tree are kept
  until they are explicitly removed, either using a remove command or
  the clean command. They can be reused, as any other nodes, using the
  copy/paste operation.
\end{description}

Generally, proof attempts are marked obsolete just after
the start of the user interface. Indeed, when you load a session in order to
modify it (not with \texttt{why3session info} for instance), \why
rebuilds the goals to prove by using the information provided in the
session. If you modify the original file (\texttt{.mlw}) or if the
transformations have changed (new version of \why), \why will detect
that. Since the provers might answer differently on these new
proof obligations, the corresponding proof attempts are marked obsolete.

\subsection{Context Menu}

The left toolbar that was present in former versions of Why3 is now
replaced by a context menu activited by clicking the right mouse button,
while cursor is on a given row of the proof session tree.

\begin{description}
\item[provers] The detected provers are listed. Note that you can hide some provers of that list using the preferences, tab \textsf{Provers}.
\item[strategies] the set of known strategies is listed
\item[Edit] starts an editor on the selected task.
\item[Replay valid obsolete proofs] all proof nodes below the selected nodes that are obsolete but whose former status was Valid are replayed.
\item[Replay all obsolete proofs] all proof nodes below the selected nodes that are obsolete are replayed.
\item[Remove] removes a proof attempt or a transformation.
\item[Clean] removes any unsuccessful proof attempt for which there is
  another successful proof attempt for the same goal
\item[Interrupt] cancels all the proof attempts currently scheduled or running.
\end{description}

\subsection{Global Menus}

\begin{description}
\item[Menu \textsf{File}]\emptyitem
\begin{description}
\item[Add File to session] adds a file in the current proof session.
%\item[Detect provers] runs provers auto-detection
\item[Preferences] opens a window for modifying preferred
  configuration parameters, see details below.
\item[Save session] saves current session state on disk. The policy to decide when to save the session is configurable, as described in the preferences below.
\item[Save files] saves edited soruce files on disk.
\item[Save session and files] saves both current session state and edited files on disk.
\item[Save all and Refresh session] save session and edited files, and refresh the current session tree.
\item[Quit] exits the GUI.
\end{description}

\item[Menu \textsf{Tools}]\emptyitem
\begin{description}
\item[Strategies] section provides a set of actions that are
  performed on the selected goal(s):
  \begin{description}
  \item[Split VC] splits the current goal into subgoals.
  % \item[Inline] inlines the definitions in the conclusion of the goal.
  %   It corresponds to the \verb|introduce_premises| transformation
  %   follwoed by \verb|inline_goal|.
  \item[Auto level 0] is a basic proof search strategy that applies a few provers
    on the goal with a short time limit.
  \item[Auto level 1] is the same as level 0 but with a longer time limit.
  \item[Auto level 2] is a strategy that first applies a few provers
    on the goal with a short time limit, then splits the goal and
    tries again on the subgoals
  \item[Auto level 3] is a strategy more elaborate than level 1, that
    attempts to apply a few transformations that are typically
    useful. It also tries the provers with a larger time limit.
  \end{description}
  A more detailed description of strategies is given in
  Section~\ref{sec:strategies}, as well as a description on how to
  design strategies of your own.

\item[Provers] provide a menu item for each detected prover. Clicking on
  such an item starts the corresponding prover on the selected
  goal(s). To start a prover with a different time limit, you may
  either change the default time limit in the Preferences, or using
  the text command field and type the prover name followed by the time
  limit.

\item[Transformations] gives access to all the known transformations.

\item[Edit] starts an editor on the selected task.

  For automatic provers, this allows to see the file sent to the
  prover.

  For interactive provers, this also allows to add or modify the
  corresponding proof script. The modifications are saved, and can be
  retrieved later even if the goal was modified.

\item[Replay valid obsolete proofs] replays all the obsolete proofs below the current node whose former state was Valid.

\item[Replay all obsolete proofs] replays all the obsolete proofs below the current node.

\item[Clean] removes any unsuccessful proof attempt for which there is
  another successful proof attempt for the same goal

\item[Remove] removes a proof attempt or a transformation.

\item[Mark obsolete] marks all the proof as
  obsolete.  This allows to replay every proof.

\item[Interrupt] cancels all the proof attempts currently scheduled or running.

\item[Bisect] performs a reduction of the context for the the current selected proof attempt, which must be a Valid one.

\item[Focus] focus the tree session view to the current node

\item[Unfocus] undoes the Focus action

\item[Copy] Marks of proof sub-tree for copy/past action

\item[Paste] Paste the previously selected sub-tree under the current node

\end{description}

\item[Menu \textsf{View}]\emptyitem
\begin{description}
\item[Enlarge font] selects a large font
\item[Reduce font] selects a smaller font
\item[Collapse proved goals] closes all the rows of the tree view
  that are proved.
\item[Expand All] expands all the rows of the tree view.
\item[Collapse under node] closes all the rows of the tree view under the given node
  that are proved.
\item[Expand below node] expands the children below the current node
\item[Expand all below node] expands the whole subtree of the current node
\item[Go to parent node] move to the parent of the current node
\item[Go to first child] mode to the first child of the current node
\item[Select next unproven goal] go to the next unproven goal after the current node
\end{description}


\item[Menu \textsf{Help}]\emptyitem
\begin{description}
\item[Legend]
Explanations of the meaning of the various icons
\item[About]
some information about this software.
\end{description}

\end{description}

\subsection{Command-line interface}

Between the top-right zone containing source files and task, and the
bottom-right zone containing various messages, a text input field
allows the user to invoke commands using a textual interface (see
Figure~\ref{fig:gui1}). The 'help' command displays a basic list of
available commands. All commands available in the menus are also
available as a textual command. However the textual interface allows
for much more possibilities, including the ability to invoke
transformations with arguments.

\subsection{Key shortcuts}


\begin{itemize}
\item Save session and files : ctrl+s
\item Save all and refresh session: ctrl+r
\item Quit : ctrl+q
\item Enlarge font : ctrl+plus
\item Reduce font : ctrl+minus
\item Collapse proven goals : !
\item Collapse current node : -
\item Expand current node : +
\item Copy : ctrl+c
\item Paste : ctrl+v
\item Select parent node : ctrl+up
\item Select next unproven goal : ctrl+down
\item Change focus to command line : return
\item Edit : e
\item Replay : r
\item Clean : c
\item Remove : del
\item Mark obsolete : o
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preferences Dialog}

The preferences dialog allows you to customize various settings. They
are grouped together under several tabs.

Note that there are to different buttons to close that dialog. The
``Close'' button will make modifications of any of these settings
effective only for the current run of the GUI. The ``Save\&Close''
button will save the modified settings in Why3 configuration file, to
make them permanent.


\begin{description}
\item[\textsf{General Settings} tab] allows one to set
  various general settings.
\begin{itemize}
\item the limits set on resource usages:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the time limit given to provers, in seconds
  \item the memory given to provers, in megabytes
  \item the maximal number of simultaneous provers allowed to run in parallel
  \end{itemize}
\item option to disallow source editing within the GUI
\item the policy for saving sessions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item always save on exit (default): the current state of the proof session is saving on exit
  \item never save on exit: the current state of the session is never saved
    automatically, you must use menu \textsf{File/Save session}
  \item ask whether to save: on exit, a popup window asks whether you
    want to save or not.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item[\textsf{Appearance settings} tab]\emptyitem
  \begin{itemize}
  \item show full task context: by default, only the local context of
    formulas is shown, that is only the declarations comming from the
    same module
  \item show attributes in formulas
  \item show corecions in formulas
  \item show source locations in formulas
  \item show time and memory limits for each proof
  \end{itemize}
  Finally, it is possible to choose an alternative icon set, provided,
  one is installed first.

\item[\textsf{Editors} tab] allows one to customize the use
  of external editors for proof scripts.
\begin{itemize}
\item The default editor to use when the \textsf{Edit} button is
  pressed.
  \urldef{\urlprfgen}{\url}{http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/}
\item For each installed prover, a specific editor can be selected to
  override the default. Typically if you install the Coq prover, then
  the editor to use will be set to ``CoqIDE'' by default, and this
  dialog allows you to select the Emacs editor and its
 \ahref{\urlprfgen}{Proof General} mode instead%
 \begin{latexonly} (\urlprfgen)\end{latexonly}.
\end{itemize}
\item[\textsf{Provers} tab]
  allows to select which of the installed provers one wants to see
  in the context menu.
\item[\textsf{Uninstalled Provers} tab] presents all the
  decision previously taken for missing provers, as described in
  Section~\ref{sec:uninstalledprovers}. You can remove any recorded
  decision by clicking on it.
\end{description}

\subsection{Displaying Counterexamples}
\label{sec:idece}

Why3 provides some support for extracting a potential counterexample
from failing proof attempts, for provers that are able to produce a
\emph{counter-model} of the proof task. Why3 attempts to turn this
counter-model into values for the free variables of the original Why3
input. Currently, this is supported for CVC4 prover version at least
1.5, and Z3 prover version at least 4.4.0.

The generation of counterexamples is fully integrated in Why3 IDE. The
recommended usage is to first start a prover normally, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ce_example0_p1}) and then click on the status icon for
the corresponding proof attempt in the tree. Alternatively, one can
use the key shortcut ``G'' or type \texttt{get-ce} in the command
entry. The result can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:ce_example0_p2}: the
same prover but with the alternative \emph{counterexamples} is
run. The resulting counterexample is displayed in two different
ways. First, it is displayed in the \textsf{Task} tab of the top-right
window, at the end of the text of the task, under the form of a list
of pairs ``variable = value'', ordered by the line number of the
source code in which that variable takes that value. Second, it is
displayed in the \textsf{Counterexample} tab of the bottom right
window, this time interleaved with the code, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ce_example0_p2}.

%%Generation of the screenshots:
%%Those commands follow the style of starting.tex. To execute them one needs to
%%do make update-doc-png.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Notes on format of displayed values}

The counterexamples can contain values of various types.
\begin{itemize}
\item Integer or real variables are displayed in decimal.
\item Bitvectors are displayed in hexadecimal
\item Integer range types are displayed in a specific notation showing their projection to integers
\item Floating-point numbers are displayed both under a decimal approximation and an exact hexadecimal value. The special values \texttt{+oo}, \texttt{-oo} and \texttt{NaN} may occur too.
\item Values from algebraic types and record types are displayed as in the Why3 syntax
\item Map values are displayed in a specific syntax detailed below
\end{itemize}

To detail the display of map values, consider the following code with
a trivially false postcondition:
\begin{whycode}
  use int.Int
  use ref.Ref
  use map.Map

  let ghost test_map (ghost x : ref (map int int)) : unit
    ensures { !x[0] <> !x[1] }
  =
    x := Map.set !x 0 3
\end{whycode}
Executing CVC4 with the ``counterexamples'' alternative on goal will trigger
counterexamples:
\begin{whycode}
  use int.Int
  use ref.Ref
  use map.Map

  let ghost test_map (ghost x : ref (map int int)) : unit
  (* x = (1 => 3,others => 0) *)
    ensures { !x[0] <> !x[1] }
    (* x = (0 => 3,1 => 3,others => 0) *)
  =
    x := Map.set !x 0 3
    (* x = (0 => 3,1 => 3,others => 0) *)
\end{whycode}

The notation for map is to be understood with indices on left of the arrows and
values on the right ``(index => value)''. The meaning of the keyword \texttt{others} is
the value for all indices that were not mentioned yet. This shows that setting
the parameter \texttt{x} to a map that has value 3 for index 1 and zero for all other
indices is a counterexample. We can check that this negates the
\why{ensures} clause.

\subsubsection{Known limitations}

The counterexamples are known not to work on the following non-exhaustive list
(which is undergoing active development):
\begin{itemize}
\item Code containing type polymorphism is often a problem due to the bad
  interaction between monomorphisation techniques and counterexamples. This is
  current an issue in particular for the Array module of the standard library.
\item\relax [TODO: complete this list]
\end{itemize}

More information on the implementation of counterexamples in Why3 can
be found in~\cite{hauzar16sefm} and in~\cite{dailler18jlamp}.  For the
producing counterexamples using the Why3 API, see
Section~\ref{sec:ce_api}.

\section{The \texttt{replay} Command}
\label{sec:why3replayer}

The \texttt{replay} command is meant to execute the proofs
stored in a \why session file, as produced by the IDE. Its
main purpose is to play non-regression tests. For instance,
\texttt{examples/regtests.sh} is a script that runs regression tests on
all the examples.
\index{replay@\texttt{replay}}

The tool is invoked in a terminal or a script using
\begin{flushleft}\ttfamily
  why3 replay \textsl{[options] <project directory>}
\end{flushleft}
The session file \texttt{why3session.xml} stored in the given
directory is loaded and all the proofs it contains are rerun. Then,
all the differences between the information stored in the session file and
the new run are shown.

Nothing is shown when there is no change in the results, whether the
considered goal is proved or not. When all the proof
are done, a summary of what is proved or not is displayed using a
tree-shape pretty print, similar to the IDE tree view after doing
``Collapse proved goals''. In other words, when a goal, a theory, or a
file is fully proved, the subtree is not shown.

\paragraph{Obsolete proofs}

When some proof attempts stored in the session file are
obsolete\index{obsolete!proof attempt},
the replay is run anyway, as with the replay button in the IDE. Then, the session
file will be updated if both
\begin{itemize}
\item all the replayed proof attempts give the same result as what
  is stored in the session
\item every goals are proved.
\end{itemize}
In other cases, you can use the IDE to update the session, or use the
option \verb|--force| described below.

\paragraph{Exit code and options}

The exit code is 0 if no difference was detected, 1 if there
was. Other exit codes mean some failure in running the replay.

Options are:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-s}] suppresses the output of the final tree view.
\item[\texttt{-q}] runs quietly (no progress info).
\item[\texttt{-{}-force}] enforces saving the session, if all proof
  attempts replayed correctly, even if some goals are not proved.
\item[\texttt{-{}-obsolete-only}] replays the proofs only if the session
  contains obsolete proof attempts.
\item[\texttt{-{}-smoke-detector \{none|top|deep\}}] tries to detect
  if the context is self-contradicting.
\item[\texttt{-{}-prover \textsl{<prover>}}] restricts the replay to the
  selected provers only.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Smoke detector}

The smoke detector tries to detect if the context is
self-contradicting and, thus, that anything can be proved in this
context. The smoke detector can't be run on an outdated session and does
not modify the session.  It has three possible configurations:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{none}] Do not run the smoke detector.
\item[\texttt{top}] The negation of each proved goal is sent with the
  same timeout to the prover that proved the original goal.
\begin{verbatim}
  Goal G : forall x:int. q x -> (p1 x \/ p2 x)
\end{verbatim}
  becomes
\begin{verbatim}
  Goal G : ~ (forall x:int. q x -> (p1 x \/ p2 x))
\end{verbatim}
  In other words, if the smoke detector is triggered, it means that the context
  of the goal \texttt{G} is self-contradicting.
\item[\texttt{deep}] This is the same technique as \texttt{top} but
  the negation is pushed under the universal quantification (without
  changing them) and under the implication. The previous example
  becomes
\begin{verbatim}
  Goal G : forall x:int. q x /\ ~ (p1 x \/ p2 x)
\end{verbatim}
  In other words, the premises of goal \texttt{G} are pushed in the
  context, so that if the smoke detector is triggered, it means that
  the context of the goal \texttt{G} and its premises are
  self-contradicting. It should be clear that detecting smoke in that
  case does not necessarily means that there is a mistake: for
  example, this could occur in the WP of a program with an unfeasible
  path.
\end{description}

At the end of the replay, the name of the goals that triggered the
smoke detector are printed:
\begin{verbatim}
  goal 'G', prover 'Alt-Ergo 0.93.1': Smoke detected!!!
\end{verbatim}
Moreover \texttt{Smoke detected} (exit code 1) is printed at the end
if the smoke detector has been triggered, or \texttt{No smoke
  detected} (exit code 0) otherwise.



\section{The \texttt{session} Command}
\label{sec:why3session}

The \texttt{session} command makes it possible to extract information from
proof sessions on the command line, or even modify them to some
extent. The invocation of this program is done under the form
\begin{verbatim}
why3 session <subcommand> [options] <session directories>
\end{verbatim}
The available subcommands are as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{info}] prints informations and statistics about sessions.
\item[\texttt{latex}] outputs session contents in LaTeX format.
\item[\texttt{html}] outputs session contents in HTML format.
\item[\texttt{update}] update session contents.
%\item[\texttt{mod}] modifies some of the proofs, selected by a filter.
%\item[\texttt{copy}] duplicates some of the proofs, selected by a filter.
%\item[\texttt{rm}] removes some of the proofs, selected by a filter.
\end{description}

The first three commands do not modify the sessions, whereas the last
modify them.

\subsection{Command \texttt{info}}

The command \texttt{why3 session info} reports various informations
about the session, depending on the following specific options.
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-{}-provers}] prints the provers that appear inside
  the session, one by line.
\item[\texttt{-{}-edited-files}] prints all the files that appear in
  the session as edited proofs.
\item[\texttt{-{}-stats}] prints various proofs statistics, as
  detailed below.
% OBSOLETE
% \item[\texttt{-{}-tree}] prints the structure of the session as a
%   tree in ASCII, as detailed below.
\item[\texttt{-{}-print0}] separates the results of the options
  \verb|provers| and \verb|--edited-files| by the character number 0
  instead of end of line \verb|\n|. That allows you to safely use
  (even if the filename contains space or carriage return) the result
  with other commands. For example you can count the number of proof
  line in all the coq edited files in a session with:
\begin{verbatim}
why3 session info --edited-files vstte12_bfs --print0 | xargs -0 coqwc
\end{verbatim}
  or you can add all the edited files in your favorite repository
  with:
\begin{verbatim}
why3 session info --edited-files --print0 vstte12_bfs.mlw | \
    xargs -0 git add
\end{verbatim}

\end{description}


% OBSOLETE

% \paragraph{Session Tree}

% The hierarchical structure of the session is printed as a tree in
% ASCII. The files, theories, goals are marked with a question mark
% \verb|?|, if they are not verified. A proof is usually said to be
% verified if the proof result is \verb|valid| and the proof is not
% obsolete.
% However here specially we separate these two properties. On
% the one hand if the proof suffers from an internal failure we mark it
% with an exclamation mark \verb|!|, otherwise if it is not valid we
% mark it with a question mark \verb|?|, finally if it is valid we add
% nothing. On the other hand if the proof is obsolete we mark it with an
% \verb|O|.

% For example, here are the session tree produced on the ``hello
% proof'' example of Section~\ref{chap:starting}.
% {\scriptsize
% \begin{verbatim}
% hello_proof---../hello_proof.why?---HelloProof?-+-G3-+-Simplify (1.5.4)?
%                                                 |    `-Alt-Ergo (0.94)
%                                                 |-G2?-+-split_goal?-+-G2.2-+-Simplify (1.5.4)
%                                                 |     |             |      `-Alt-Ergo (0.94)
%                                                 |     |             `-G2.1?-+-Coq (8.3pl4)?
%                                                 |     |                     |-Simplify (1.5.4)?
%                                                 |     |                     `-Alt-Ergo (0.94)?
%                                                 |     |-Simplify (1.5.4)?
%                                                 |     `-Alt-Ergo (0.94)?
%                                                 `-G1---Simplify (1.5.4)
% \end{verbatim}
% }

\paragraph{Session Statistics}

The proof statistics given by option \verb|--stats| are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of goals: give both the total number of goals, and the
  number of those that are proved (possibly after a transformation).
\item Goals not proved: list of goals of the session which are not
  proved by any prover, even after a transformation.
\item Goals proved by only one prover: the goals for which there is only
  one successful proof. For each of these, the prover which was
  successful is printed. This also includes the sub-goals generated by
  transformations.
\item Statistics per prover: for each of the prover used in the
  session, the number of proved goals is given. This also includes the
  sub-goals generated by transformations. The respective minimum,
  maximum and average time and on average running time is
  shown. Beware that these time data are computed on the
  goals \emph{where the prover was successful}.
\end{itemize}

For example, here are the session statistics produced on the ``hello
proof'' example of Section~\ref{chap:starting}.
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
== Number of root goals ==
  total: 3  proved: 2

== Number of sub goals ==
  total: 2  proved: 1

== Goals not proved ==
  +-- file ../hello_proof.why
    +-- theory HelloProof
      +-- goal G2
        +-- transformation split_goal_right
          +-- goal G2.0

== Goals proved by only one prover ==
  +-- file ../hello_proof.why
    +-- theory HelloProof
      +-- goal G1: Alt-Ergo 0.99.1
      +-- goal G2
        +-- transformation split_goal_right
          +-- goal G2.1: Alt-Ergo 0.99.1
      +-- goal G3: Alt-Ergo 0.99.1

== Statistics per prover: number of proofs, time (minimum/maximum/average) in seconds ==
  Alt-Ergo 0.99.1     :   3   0.00   0.00   0.00
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Command \texttt{latex}}

Command \texttt{latex} produces a summary of the replay under the form
of a tabular environment in LaTeX, one tabular for each theory, one
per file.

The specific options are
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-style \textsl{<n>}}] sets output style (1 or 2, default 1)
  Option \texttt{-style 2} produces an alternate version of LaTeX
  output, with a different layout of the tables.
\item[\texttt{-o \textsl{<dir>}}] indicates where
  to produce LaTeX files (default: the session directory).
\item[\texttt{-longtable}] uses the `longtable' environment instead of
  `tabular'.
\item[\texttt{-e \textsl{<elem>}}] produces a table for the given element, which is
  either a file, a theory or a root goal. The element must be specified
  using its path in dot notation, \eg \verb|file.theory.goal|. The
  file produced is named accordingly,
  \eg \verb|file.theory.goal.tex|.  This option can be given several
  times to produce several tables in one run. When this option is
  given at least once, the default behavior that is to produce one
  table per theory is disabled.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Customizing LaTeX output}

The generated LaTeX files contain some macros that must be defined
externally.  Various definitions can be given to them to customize the
output.
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{\bs{}provername}] macro with one parameter, a prover name
\item[\texttt{\bs{}valid}] macro with one parameter, used where the corresponding prover answers that the goal is valid. The parameter is the time in seconds.
\item[\texttt{\bs{}noresult}] macro without parameter, used where no result
  exists for the corresponding prover
\item[\texttt{\bs{}timeout}] macro without parameter, used where the corresponding prover reached the time limit
\item[\texttt{\bs{}explanation}] macro with one parameter, the goal name or its explanation
\end{description}

Figure~\ref{fig:custom-latex} suggests some definitions for these
macros, while Figures~\ref{fig:latex} and~\ref{fig:latexstyle2} show
the tables obtained from the HelloProof example of
Section~\ref{chap:starting}, respectively with style 1 and 2.

\subsection{Command \texttt{html}}

This command produces a summary of the proof session in HTML syntax.
There are two styles of output: `table' and `simpletree'. The default is
`table'.

The file generated is named \texttt{why3session.html} and is written
in the session directory by default (see option \texttt{-o} to
override this default).

\begin{figure}[t]
%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{center}
\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{hello_proof.png}}
\end{center}
%END LATEX
\begin{htmlonly}
\begin{rawhtml}
<h1>Why3 Proof Results for Project "hello_proof"</h1>
<h2><span style="color:#FF0000">Theory "hello_proof.HelloProof": not fully verified</span></h2>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td colspan="2">Obligations</td><td text-rotation="90">Alt-Ergo 0.99.1</td><td text-rotation="90">Coq 8.7.1</td></tr>

<tr><td style="background-color:#C0FFC0" colspan="2">G3</td><td style="background-color:#C0FFC0">0.00</td><td style="background-color:#E0E0E0">---</td></tr>
</table>
\end{rawhtml}
\end{htmlonly}
\caption{HTML table produced for the HelloProof example}
\label{fig:html}
\end{figure}

The style `table' outputs the contents of the session as a table,
similar to the LaTeX output above. Figure~\ref{fig:html} is the HTML
table produced for the `HelloProof' example, as typically shown in a
Web browser. The gray cells filled with \texttt{---} just mean that
the prover was not run on the corresponding goal. Green background
means the result was ``Valid'', other cases are in orange
background. The red background for a goal means that the goal was not
proved.

The style `simpletree' displays the contents of the session under the
form of tree, similar to the tree view in the IDE. It uses only basic
HTML tags such as \verb|<ul>| and \verb|<li>|.

Specific options for this command are as follows.
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-{}-style \textsl{<style>}}] sets the style to use, among
  \texttt{simpletree} and \texttt{table}; defaults to
  \texttt{table}.

\item[\texttt{-o \textsl{<dir>}}] sets the directory where to output
  the produced files (`\texttt{-}' for stdout). The default is to output
  in the same directory as the session itself.

\item[\texttt{-{}-context}] adds context around the generated code in
  order to allow direct visualization (header, css, ...). It also adds
  in the output directory all the needed external files. It can't be set with
  stdout output.

\item[\texttt{-{}-add\_pp \textsl{<suffix>} \textsl{<cmd>} \textsl{<out\_suffix>}}] sets a specific
  pretty-printer for files with the given suffix. Produced files use
  \texttt{\textsl{<out\_suffix>}} as suffix. \texttt{\textsl{<cmd>}} must contain
  `\texttt{\%i}' which will be replaced by the input file and
  `\texttt{\%o}' which will be replaced by the output file.

\item[\texttt{-{}-coqdoc}] uses the \verb|coqdoc| command to display Coq proof
  scripts. This is equivalent to \texttt{-{}-add\_pp .v "coqdoc
    -{}-no-index -{}-html -o \%o \%i" .html}

\end{description}



\subsection{Command \texttt{update}}

The command \texttt{why3 session update} permits to modify
the session contents, depending on the following specific options.
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-rename-file \textsl{<src>} \textsl{<dst>}}] renames the file \textsl{<src>} to \textsl{<dst>} in the session. The file \textsl{<src>} itself is also renamed to \textsl{<dst>} in your filesystem.
\end{description}


\section{The \texttt{doc} Command}
\label{sec:why3doc}

This tool can produce HTML pages from \why source code.
\why code for theories or modules is output in
preformatted HTML code. Comments are interpreted in three different ways.
\begin{itemize}
\item Comments starting with at least three stars are completed
  ignored.
\item Comments starting with two stars are interpreted as textual
  documentation. Special constructs are interpreted as described
  below. When the previous line is not empty, the comment is indented to
  the right, so as to be displayed as a description of that line.
\item Comments starting with one star only are interpreted as code
  comments, and are typeset as the code
\end{itemize}

Additionally, all the \why identifiers are typeset with links so that
one can navigate through the HTML documentation, going from some
identifier use to its definition.

\paragraph{Options}

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-o \textsl{<dir>}}] defines the directory where to
  output the HTML files.
\item[\texttt{-{}-output \textsl{<dir>}}] is the same as \verb|-o|.
\item[\texttt{-{}-index}] generates an index file \texttt{index.html}.
  This is the default behavior if more than one file
  is passed on the command line.
\item[\texttt{-{}-no-index}] prevents the generation of an index file.
\item[\texttt{-{}-title \textsl{<title>}}] sets title of the
  index page.
\item[\texttt{-{}-stdlib-url \textsl{<url>}}] sets a URL for files
  found in load path, so that links to definitions can be added.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Typesetting textual comments}

Some constructs are interpreted:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\{\textsl{c text}\}} interprets character \textsl{c} as
  some typesetting command:
  \begin{description}
  \item[1-6] a heading of level 1 to 6 respectively
  \item[h] raw HTML
  \end{description}
\item \texttt{`\textsl{code}`} is a code escape: the text
  \textsl{code} is typeset as \why code.
\end{itemize}

A CSS file \verb|style.css| suitable for rendering is generated in the
same directory as output files. This CSS style can be modified manually,
since regenerating the HTML documentation will not overwrite an existing
\verb|style.css| file.

\section{The \texttt{latex} Command}

This tool prints inductive rules defined in Why3 in LaTeX using the
\texttt{mathpartir} package\index{latex@\texttt{latex}}.

The typesetting of variables, record fields, and functions is
parameterized by LaTeX commands. Dummy definitions of these commands are
printed in comments and have to be defined by the user. Trailing digits
and quotes are removed from the command names to reduce the number of
commands. The commands have a common, configurable prefix (default: \texttt{IND}).

\paragraph{Reconstruction of record updates}
Due to the technical workings of the Why3 parser, record updates in the
source code \texttt{\{x with f=e; ...\}} are normally printed as record
constructions \texttt{\{f=e; g=x.g; ...\}}. However, such record
constructions in the LaTeX export tend to be quite verbose in comparison
to record updates.

The \texttt{why3 latex} allows for detecting and converting record
constructions back to record updates. It works as follows: Record shapes
(names of the record type and its fields) are specified as command line
arguments \texttt{-{}-record}. Record constructions are then tested,
whether a majority of the assigned expressions have the form
\texttt{x.g} for one variable \texttt{x} and a field \texttt{g}
corresponding to the order given in the record shape. In this case, the
other field assignments \texttt{f=e} constitute the record update of the
form \texttt{\{x with f=e; ...\}}.

\paragraph{Options}

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{-{}-prefix~\textsl{<prefix}}] Set the prefix for LaTeX
    commands to \textsl{<prefix>}.
  \item[\texttt{-{}-record~\textsl{<name>}:\textsl{<field>},\ldots}]
    Convert constructions of record \textsl{<name>} to record updates.
\end{description}
