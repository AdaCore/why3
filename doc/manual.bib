  abstract = {Why3 is the next generation of the
  Why software verification platform.
  Why3 clearly separates the purely logical
  specification part from generation of verification conditions for programs.
  This article focuses on the former part.
  Why3 comes with a new enhanced language of
  logical specification. It features a rich library of
  proof task transformations that can be chained to produce a suitable
  input for a large set of theorem provers, including SMT solvers,
  TPTP provers, as well as interactive proof assistants.}

                  combination of software and hardware. For operations
                  specified in the normative part of this standard,
                  numerical results and exceptions are uniquely
                  determined by the values of the input data, sequence
