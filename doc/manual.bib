                  implementation of a floating-point system conforming
                  to this standard may be realized entirely in
                  software, entirely in hardware, or in any
                  combination of software and hardware. For operations
                  specified in the normative part of this standard,
                  numerical results and exceptions are uniquely
                  determined by the values of the input data, sequence
                  of operations, and destination formats, all under

  title =        {A Pragmatic Type System for Deductive Verification},

  institution =  {Universit\'e Paris Sud},
  year =         2016,
  abstract = { In the context of deductive verication, it is customary
                  today to handle programs with pointers using either
                  separation logic, dynamic frames, or explicit memory
                  models. Yet we can observe that in numerous
                  programs, a large amount of code ts within the scope
                  of Hoare logic, provided we can statically control
                  aliasing. When this is the case, the code
                  correctness can be reduced to simpler verication
                  conditions which do not require any explicit memory
                  model. This makes verication conditions more
                  amenable both to automated theorem proving and to
                  manual inspection and debugging. In this paper, we
                  devise a method of such static aliasing control for
                  a programming language featuring nested data
                  structures with mutable components. Our solution is
                  based on a type system with singleton regions and
                  eects, which we prove to be sound.},
