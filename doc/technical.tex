\section{Structure of Session Files}

The proof session state is stored in an XML file named
\texttt{\textsl{<dir>}/why3session.xml}, where \texttt{\textsl{<dir>}}
is the directory of the project.
The XML file follows the DTD given in \texttt{share/why3session.dtd} and reproduced below.
\lstinputlisting{../share/why3session.dtd}


\section{Prover Detection}
\label{sec:proverdetecttiondata}

All the necessary data configuration for the automatic detection of
installed provers is stored in the file
\texttt{provers-detection-data.conf} typically located in directory
\verb|/usr/local/share/why3| after installation. The contents of this
file is reproduced below.
%BEGIN LATEX

\section{The \texttt{why3.conf} Configuration File}
\label{sec:whyconffile}
\index{why3.conf@\texttt{why3.conf}}\index{configuration file}

One can use a custom configuration file. The \why
tools look for it in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the file specified by the \texttt{-C} or \texttt{-{}-config} options,
\item the file specified by the environment variable
  \texttt{WHY3CONFIG} if set,
\item the file \texttt{\$HOME/.why3.conf}
  (\texttt{\$USERPROFILE/.why3.conf} under Windows) or, in the case of
  local installation, \texttt{why3.conf} in the top directory of \why sources.
\end{enumerate}
If none of these files exist, a built-in default configuration is used.

The configuration file is a human-readable text file, which consists
of association pairs arranged in sections.

A section begins with a header inside square brackets and ends at the
beginning of the next section. The header of a
section can be only one identifier, \texttt{main} and \texttt{ide} in
the example, or it can be composed by a family name and one family
argument, \texttt{prover} is one family name, \texttt{coq} and
\texttt{alt-ergo} are the family argument.

Sections contain associations \texttt{key=value}. A value is either
an integer (\eg \texttt{-555}), a boolean (\texttt{true}, \texttt{false}),
or a string (\eg \texttt{"emacs"}). Some specific keys can be attributed
multiple values and are
thus allowed to occur several times inside a given section. In that
case, the relative order of these associations matter.

\section{Drivers for External Provers}
\label{sec:drivers}

Drivers for external provers are readable files from directory
\texttt{drivers}. Experimented users can modify them to change the way
the external provers are called, in particular which transformations
are applied to goals.

[TO BE COMPLETED LATER]

\section{Transformations}
\label{sec:transformations}

Here is a quick documentation of provided transformations. We give
first the non-splitting ones, \eg those which produce one goal as
result, and others which produces any number of goals.

Notice that the set of available transformations in your own
installation is given by
\begin{verbatim}
why3 --list-transforms
\end{verbatim}
\index{list-transforms@\verb+--list-transforms+}

\subsection{Non-splitting transformations}

\begin{description}

\item[eliminate\_algebraic] replaces algebraic data types by first-order
definitions~\cite{paskevich09rr}.

\item[eliminate\_builtin] removes definitions of symbols that are
  declared as builtin in the driver, \ie with a ``syntax'' rule.
\item[eliminate\_definition\_func]
  replaces all function definitions with axioms.
\item[eliminate\_definition\_pred]
  replaces all predicate definitions with axioms.
\item[eliminate\_definition]
  applies both transformations above.
\item[eliminate\_mutual\_recursion]
  replaces mutually recursive definitions with axioms.
\item[eliminate\_recursion]
  replaces all recursive definitions with axioms.

\item[eliminate\_if\_term] replaces terms of the form \texttt{if
    formula then t2 else t3} by lifting them at the level of formulas.
  This may introduce \texttt{if then else } in formulas.

\item[eliminate\_if\_fmla] replaces formulas of the form \texttt{if f1 then f2
  else f3} by an equivalent formula using implications and other
  connectives.

\item[eliminate\_if]
  applies both transformations above.

\item[eliminate\_inductive] replaces inductive predicates by
  (incomplete) axiomatic definitions, \ie construction axioms and
  an inversion axiom.

\item[eliminate\_let\_fmla]
  eliminates \texttt{let} by substitution, at the predicate level.

\item[eliminate\_let\_term]
  eliminates \texttt{let} by substitution, at the term level.

\item[eliminate\_let]
  applies both transformations above.

% \item[encoding\_decorate\_mono]

% \item[encoding\_enumeration]

\item[encoding\_smt]
  encodes polymorphic types into monomorphic type~\cite{conchon08smt}.

\item[encoding\_tptp]
  encodes theories into unsorted logic. %~\cite{cruanes10}.

% \item[filter\_trigger] *)

% \item[filter\_trigger\_builtin] *)

% \item[filter\_trigger\_no\_predicate] *)

% \item[hypothesis\_selection] *)
%   Filter hypothesis of goals~\cite{couchot07ftp,cruanes10}. *)

\item[inline\_all]
  expands all non-recursive definitions.

\item[inline\_goal] expands all outermost symbols of the goal that
  have a non-recursive definition.

\item[inline\_trivial]
  removes definitions of the form
\begin{whycode}
function  f x_1 ... x_n = (g e_1 ... e_k)
predicate p x_1 ... x_n = (q e_1 ... e_k)
\end{whycode}
when each $e_i$ is either a ground term or one of the $x_j$, and
each $x_1 \dots x_n$ occurs at most once in all the $e_i$.

\item[introduce\_premises] moves antecedents of implications and
  universal quantifications of the goal into the premises of the task.

% \item[remove\_triggers] *)
%   removes the triggers in all quantifications. *)

\item[simplify\_array] automatically rewrites the task using the lemma
  \verb|Select_eq| of theory \verb|array.Array|.

\item[simplify\_formula] reduces trivial equalities $t=t$ to true and
  then simplifies propositional structure: removes true, false, simplifies
  $f \land f$ to $f$, etc.

\item[simplify\_recursive\_definition] reduces mutually recursive
  definitions if they are not really mutually recursive, \eg
\begin{whycode}
function f : ... = .... g ...
with g : ... = e
\end{whycode}
becomes
\begin{whycode}
function g : ... = e
function f : ... = ... g ...
\end{whycode}
if $f$ does not occur in $e$.

\item[simplify\_trivial\_quantification]
  simplifies quantifications of the form
\begin{verbatim}
forall x, x=t -> P(x)
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
forall x, t=x -> P(x)
\end{verbatim}
when $x$ does not occur in $t$ into
\begin{verbatim}
P(t)
\end{verbatim}
  More generally, it applies this simplification whenever $x=t$ appears
  in a negative position.

\item[simplify\_trivial\_quantification\_in\_goal]
  is the same as above but it applies only in the goal.

\item[split\_premise]
  splits conjunctive premises.

\end{description}

\subsection{Splitting transformations}

\begin{description}

\item[full\_split\_all]
  performs both \texttt{split\_premise} and \texttt{full\_split\_goal}.

\item[full\_split\_goal] puts the goal in a conjunctive form,
  returns the corresponding set of subgoals. The number of subgoals
  generated may be exponential in the size of the initial goal.

\item[simplify\_formula\_and\_task] is the same as \texttt{simplify\_formula}
  but it also removes the goal if it is equivalent to true.

\item[split\_all]
  performs both \texttt{split\_premise} and \texttt{split\_goal}.

\item[split\_goal] if the goal is a conjunction of goals, returns the
  corresponding set of subgoals. The number of subgoals generated is linear in
  the size of the initial goal.

\item[split\_intro]
  moves the antecedents into the premises when a goal is an implication.
