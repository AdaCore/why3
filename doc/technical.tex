\section{Structure of Session Files}

The proof session state is stored in an XML file named
\texttt{\textsl{<dir>}/why3session.xml}, where \texttt{\textsl{<dir>}}
is the directory of the project.
The XML file follows the DTD given in \texttt{share/why3session.dtd} and reproduced below.
\lstinputlisting{../share/why3session.dtd}


\section{Prover Detection}
\label{sec:proverdetecttiondata}

All the necessary data configuration for the automatic detection of
installed provers is stored in the file
\texttt{provers-detection-data.conf} typically located in directory
\verb|/usr/local/share/why3| after installation. The contents of this
file is reproduced below.

\section{The \texttt{why3.conf} Configuration File}
\label{sec:whyconffile}
\index{why3.conf@\texttt{why3.conf}}\index{configuration file}

One can use a custom configuration file. The \why
tools look for it in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the file specified by the \texttt{-C} or \texttt{-{}-config} options,
\item the file specified by the environment variable
  \texttt{WHY3CONFIG} if set,
\item the file \texttt{\$HOME/.why3.conf}
  (\texttt{\$USERPROFILE/.why3.conf} under Windows) or, in the case of
  local installation, \texttt{why3.conf} in the top directory of \why sources.
\end{enumerate}
If none of these files exist, a built-in default configuration is used.

The configuration file is a human-readable text file, which consists
of association pairs arranged in sections.

A section begins with a header inside square brackets and ends at the
beginning of the next section. The header of a
section can be only one identifier, \texttt{main} and \texttt{ide} in
the example, or it can be composed by a family name and one family
argument, \texttt{prover} is one family name, \texttt{coq} and
\texttt{alt-ergo} are the family argument.

Sections contain associations \texttt{key=value}. A value is either
an integer (\eg \texttt{-555}), a boolean (\texttt{true}, \texttt{false}),
or a string (\eg \texttt{"emacs"}). Some specific keys can be attributed
multiple values and are
thus allowed to occur several times inside a given section. In that
case, the relative order of these associations matter.

\section{Drivers for External Provers}
\label{sec:drivers}

Drivers for external provers are readable files from directory
\texttt{drivers}. Experimented users can modify them to change the way
the external provers are called, in particular which transformations
are applied to goals.

[TO BE COMPLETED LATER]

\section{Transformations}
\label{sec:transformations}

This section documents the available transformations. We first
describe the most important ones, and then we provide a quick
documentation of the others, first the non-splitting ones, \eg those
which produce exactly one goal as result, and the others which produce any
number of goals.

Notice that the set of available transformations in your own
installation is given by
\begin{verbatim}
why3 --list-transforms
\end{verbatim}
\index{list-transforms@\verb+--list-transforms+}

\subsection{Inlining definitions}

Those transformations generally amount to replace some applications of
function or predicate symbols with its definition.

\begin{description}

\item[inline\_trivial]
  expands and removes definitions of the form
\begin{whycode}
function  f x_1 ... x_n = (g e_1 ... e_k)
predicate p x_1 ... x_n = (q e_1 ... e_k)
\end{whycode}
when each $e_i$ is either a ground term or one of the $x_j$, and
each $x_1 \dots x_n$ occurs at most once in all the $e_i$.
\index{inline-trivial@\verb+inline_trivial+}

\item[inline\_goal] expands all outermost symbols of the goal that
  have a non-recursive definition.
\index{inline-goal@\verb+inline_goal+}

\item[inline\_all]
  expands all non-recursive definitions.
\index{inline-all@\verb+inline_all+}

\end{description}


\subsection{Induction Transformations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Induction on an algebraic data type: \verb|induction_ty_lex|
\index{induction-ty-lex@\verb+induction_ty_lex+}

[TO BE COMPLETED]

\item Induction on a inductive predicate:

[TO BE COMPLETED]

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simplification by Computation}

Those transformations simplifies the goal by applying several kind of
simplifications. The transformations differ only by the kind of rules they
apply:

\verb|compute_in_goal| aggressively apply all known
computation/simplification rules

\index{compute-in-goal@\verb+compute_in_goal+}

\verb|compute_specified| perform rewriting using only built-in operators and
user-provided rules

\index{compute-specified@\verb+compute_specified+}

\begin{itemize}
\item Computations with built-in symbols, \eg operations on integers,
  when applied to explicit constants, are evaluated. This includes
  evaluation of equality when a decision can be made (on integer
  constants, on constructors of algebraic data types), Boolean
  evaluation, simplification of pattern-matching/conditional expression,
  extraction of record fields, and beta-reduction.
  At best, these computations reduce the goal to
  \verb|true| and the transformations thus does not produce any sub-goal.
  For example, a goal
  like \verb|6*7=42| is solved by those transformations.
\item Unfolding of definitions, as done by \verb|inline_goal|.
  \verb|compute_in_goal| unfold all definitions, including recursive ones.
  For \verb|compute_specified|, the user can enable unfolding of a specific
  logic symbol by attaching the meta \verb|rewrite_def| to the symbol.
\begin{whycode}
function sqr (x:int) : int = x * x

meta "rewrite_def" function sqr
\end{whycode}
\item Rewriting using axioms or lemmas declared as rewrite rules. When
  an axiom (or a lemma) has one of the forms
\begin{whycode}
axiom a: forall ... t1 = t2
\end{whycode}
  or
\begin{whycode}
axiom a: forall ... f1 <-> f2
\end{whycode}
  then the user can declare
\begin{whycode}
meta "rewrite" axiom a
\end{whycode}
  to turn this axiom into a rewrite rules. Rewriting is always done
  from left to right. Beware that there is no check for termination
  nor for confluence of the set of rewrite rules declared.
\item Bound on the number of reduction: the computations performed by
  this transformation can take an arbitrarily large number of steps,
  or even not terminate. For this reason, the number of steps is
  bounded by a maximal value, which is set by default to 1000. This
  value can be increased by another meta, \eg
\begin{whycode}
meta "compute_max_steps" 1_000_000
\end{whycode}
  When this upper limit is reached, the partly-reduced goal
  is returned as the result of the transformation.
\end{itemize}
