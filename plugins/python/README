A plugin to verify programs written in a (microscopic) fragment of Python.
Designed for teaching purposes.

See tests/python/*.py for examples.

Limitations wrt Python:
- types are limited to integers and lists of integers
- a list is not resizable (i.e. it is a mere array)
- a function must return an integer or nothing

Todo:
- function/predicate with a definition (currently not supported);
  note: we would need to provide the type (int/array) of the arguments
