A plugin to verify programs written in a (microscopic) fragment of C.

Differences/limitations wrt C:
- types are limited to integers and arrays of integers
- integers of type 'int' only, and assumed to be of arbitrary precision
- scanf is limited to scanf("%d", &x)
- a call to printf is ignored (but arguments are evaluated first)

Todo:
- spec before or after {
- rand() returns a nonnegative integer
- arrays, stack-allocated
    int a[n]; --> array_create n
- functions return either void or int, not int*
- for loop
- function/predicate, possibly with a definition
//@ function int foo(int x, int y);
//@ function int bar(int x, int y) = x+y;
//@ predicate buz(int x, int y) = x+y >= 0;
- at/old
// at(term, label)
// old(term)

- lemma function?
