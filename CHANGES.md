:x: marks a potential source of incompatibility

Standard library
  * new library `ufloat`: unbounded floating-point numbers

Core
  * extended notion of strategies: goal-oriented strategies

Plugins
  * new goal-oriented strategy `forward_propagation` to automatically
    propagate rounding errors in formulas involving unbounded
    floats. See examples in `examples/numeric`

Version 1.7.2, April 18, 2024
-----------------------------

Bug fixes
  * restored the legacy shortcut for Alt-Ergo 2.5
  * fixed various bugs in the lexer of `why3 doc`
  * made prover detection more reliable when paths need escaping


Version 1.7.1, January 20, 2024
-------------------------------

Bug fixes
  * restored syntax highlighting in IDE
  * improved detection of Isabelle 2022 and Alt-Ergo 2.5

Version 1.7.0, November 24, 2023
--------------------------------

WhyML language
  * syntax `module Impl: Intf ... end` can be used to hide the
    details of an implementation during proofs

MLCFG language
  * `variant` clauses are supported with the `stackify` backend
  * `invariant` names are now optional and deprecated

Input formats
  * a new input format `.sexp` is supported for programs written as
    S-expressions; this input format, intended as an intermediate language,
    is compatible with the output of `why3 pp --output=sexp` and
    the S-expressions generated by the API function `Ptree.sexp_of_mlw_file`

Standard library
  * library `ieee_float`: added conversions between floating-point numbers
    and signed bitvectors, with appropriate mappings to SMT-LIB

IDE
  * strategies can now execute a group of provers concurrently in a single
    `call` step, by separating provers by a `|`; default strategies now
    make use of this parallelism for time limits larger than 1 second

Tools
  * option `--warn-off=...` can now be used to disable individual warnings;
    available warnings can be listed using `--list-warning-flags`
  * driver files appearing in a configuration file loaded using option
    `--extra-config` are now also searched in the sub-directory of that
    configuration file
  * `why3 session info` now produces separate statistics per session
    and overall statistics; see Section 5.5.1 of the manual :x:
  * `why3 session update` now supports options `--mark-obsolete`,
    `--remove-proofs`, and `--add-provers`, together with selection of proof
    nodes via filters; see Section 5.5.4 of the manual
  * `why3 session create` now generates a new session for the specified files;
    see Section 5.5.5 of the manual
  * `why3 session info` now has an option `--graph=[all|hist|scatter]`;
    `all` corresponds to the old behavior, while `hist` and `scatter` provide
    finer graphs for pairwise comparison of provers
  * `why3 bench` now provides a way to run all the proof attempts that
    have not been run before; see Section 5.13 of the manual
  * `why3 replay` now supports option `--ignore-shapes`, which disables the use
    of shapes when merging sessions
  * time taken by solvers is now uniformly reported with the precision
    of a microsecond, in particular in session files; cumulative times,
    e.g., reported by `why3 session info --provers-stats`, are more precise;
    the `time` regexp in driver files is deprecated and the time taken by
    solvers is now measured by Why3 directly

API
  * source locations now use both a starting line and an ending line;
    the fourth number is thus the column on the last line :x:
  * several functions from `Call_prover` and `Driver` now take as input a
    `Whyconf.main` configuration type instead of directly taking `libdir`
    and `datadir` :x:
  * `Whyconf.load_driver` has been replaced by `Driver.load_driver_for_prover` :x:
  * `Warning.emit` has been replaced by `Loc.warning` :x:

----------------------------

Core
  * improved support of counter-examples
  * attribute `[@vc:sp]` on an expression switches from traditional WP
    to Flanagan-Saxe-like VC generation
  * type invariants now produce logical axioms;
    a type with an invariant must be proved to be inhabited :x:
  * logical symbols can no longer be used in non-ghost code;
    in particular, there is no polymorphic equality in programs any more,
    so equality functions must be declared/defined on a per-type basis
    (already done for type `int` in the standard library) :x:

Language
  * numerous changes to syntax, see documentation appendix :x:

  * support for type coercions in logic using `meta coercion`
  * keyword `theory` is deprecated; use `module` instead
  * term on the left of sequence `;` must be of type `unit` :x:
  * cloned axioms turn into lemmas; use `with axiom my_axiom`
    or `with axiom .` to keep them as axioms :x:
  * `any <type> <spec>` produces an existential precondition;
    use `val f : <type> <spec> in ...` (unsafe!) instead :x:
  * `use T` and `clone T` now import the generated namespace T;
    use `use T as T` and `clone T as T` to prevent this :x:
  * `pure { <term> }` produces a ghost value in program code
  * `a <-> b <-> c` is now parsed as `(a <-> b) /\ (b <-> c)`;
    `a <-> b -> c` is now rejected :x:

Standard library
  * machine integers in `mach.int.*` are now range types :x:
  * added a minimal memory model for the C language in `mach.c`

Version 0.88.0, October 6, 2017
-------------------------------

Language
  * added two new forms of type declarations: integer range types and
    floating-point types. To denote constants in such types, integer
    constants and real constants can be cast to such types. This
    support is exploited in drivers for provers that support bitvector
    theories (CVC4, Z3) and floating-point theory (Z3).
    More details in the manual, section 7.2.4 "Theories".
  * a quote character `'` inside an identifier must either be at the
    end, or be followed by either a digit, the underscore character
    `_` or another quote. Identifiers with a quote followed by a
    letter are reserved. :x:

Standard library

    More details in the manual, section 10.6 "Proof Strategies".
  * counterexamples: better support for array values, support for

Version 0.85, September 17, 2014
--------------------------------

Langage

Proof sessions
  * use the full path of identifiers when the user introduces namespaces
    (BTS #17181)

Transformations
  * fix a soundness bug in `compute_in_goal` regarding the handling of
    logical implication. :x:
  * several improvements to `compute_in_goal`:
    - left-hand side of rewrite rules can be any symbols, not only
      non-interpreted ones.
    - perform beta-reduction when possible
    - the maximal number of reduction steps can be increased using meta
      `compute_max_steps`
    - the transformation is documented in details in the manual

  * `why3replayer` has been moved to the `replay` subcommand :x:
  * other tools have been moved to `why3` subcommands too: `config`, `doc`, `ide`,
    `session`, `wc`. For local usage, the old commands are still available. :x:

Proof sessions
  * session files are split in two parts: `why3session.xml` and
    `why3shapes`. The latter file contains the checksums and the shapes
    for the goals. That second file is not strictly needed for
    replaying a proof session, it is only useful when input programs
    are modified, to track obsolete goals. If Why3 is compiled with
    compression support (provided by the `ocamlzip` library) then files for
    shapes are compressed into `why3shapes.gz`.

Standard library
  * renamed `array.ArraySorted` into `array.IntArraySorted`;
    `array.ArraySorted` is now generic, with type and order relation parameters :x:
  * reduced amount of `use export` in the standard library: theories
    now only export the symbols they define. Users may need to insert more
    `use import` in their theories (typically `int.Int`, `option.Option`,
    `list.List`, etc.). :x:

    computation, as much as possible

Version 0.83, March 14, 2014
----------------------------

Language
  * extra semicolons are now allowed at end of blocks

    backward compatible thanks to `shape_version` numbers in
    `why3session.xml` files
  * options name and default of `why3session csv` changed :x:

Miscellaneous
  * emacs: `why.el` renamed to `why3.el` :x:

  * Alt-Ergo, Z3, CVC3, Yices: support for built-in theory of arrays

IDE
  * interactive detection of provers disabled because incompatible
    with session. Detection must be done with `why3config --detect-provers`
  * tool "Replay" works
  * tool "Reload" reloads the file from disk. No need to exit IDE anymore
  * does not use `Threads` anymore, thanks to `Call_provers.query_call`
  * displays explanations using labels of the form `"expl:..."`
  * dropped dependency on `Sqlite3`

API
  * functions to create an environment are now exported from `Env` :x:
  * calls to prover can now be asynchronous.
    `Driver.prove_task` now returns some intermediate value
    (of type `prover_call`), which can be queried in two ways:
    - blocking way with `Call_provers.wait_on_call`
    - non-blocking way with `Call_provers.query_call`

    So old code performing `prove_task t () ()` should be translated to
    `wait_on_call (prove_task t ()) ()`. :x:

Bug fixes
  * IDE: bug 12244 resolved by using `Task.task_equal`
  * Alt-Ergo: no triggers for `exists` quantifier
  * Coq: polymorphic inductive predicates
  * Coq: fixed bug 12934: type def with several type params

Version 0.64, February 16, 2011
-------------------------------

Language
  * `/\` renamed into `&&` and `\/` into `||` :x:
  * algebraic types: must be well-founded, non-positive constructors
    are forbidden, recursive functions and predicates must
    structurally terminate
  * accept lowercase names for axioms, lemmas, goals, and cases in
    inductive predicates

Transformations
  * `split-goal` does not split under disjunction anymore

Tools
  * `why.conf` is no more looked for in the current directory; use `-C` or
    `WHY3CONFIG` instead
  * when `why.conf` is changed, a backup copy is made in `why.conf.bak`
  * `why.conf` now contains a magic number; configuration must be
    rebuilt with `why3config` if the magic number has changed
  * `why3config`: `--autodetect-provers` renamed to `--detect-provers`,
                  `--autodetect-plugins` renamed to `--detect-plugins`;
    new option `--detect` to perform both detections
  * `why3config`: `--conf_file` is replaced by `-C` and `--config`

Drivers
  * TPTP: encoding by explicit polymorphism is not anymore the
    default encoding for TPTP provers. It is now forbidden to use this
    encoding in presence of finite types.

IDE
  * source file names are stored in database with paths relative
    to the database, so that databases are now easier to move from a
    machine to another (e.g when they are stored in source control
    repositories)

Provers
  * better Gappa output: support for `sqrt`, for negative constants

Miscellaneous
  * `configure`: fixed `--enable-local`
  * `configure`: if possible, use `ocamlfind` to find `lablgtk2` and `sqlite3`
  * labels in terms and formulas are not printed by default

Version 0.63, December 21, 2010
-------------------------------

  * first public release. See release notes in manual
