* marks an incompatible change

  * [emacs] why.el renamed to why3.el
  * [GTK sourceview] why.lang renamed to why3.lang

version 0.81, March 25, 2013
============================

  o [prover] experimental support for SPASS >= 3.8 (with types)
  o [prover] support for Z3 4.3.*
  o [prover] fixed Coq 8.4 support for theory real.Trigonometry
  o [prover] support for CVC4
  o [prover] support for mathematica
  o [prover] support for MathSAT5
  o [logic] accept type expressions in clone substitutions
  o [whyml] support for relation chains (e.g., "e1 = e2 < e3")
  * [whyml] every exception raised in a function must be listed
    in as "raises { ... }" clause. A postcondition may be omitted
    and equals to "true" by default.
  * [whyml] if a function definition contains a "writes { ... }"
    clause, then every write effect must be listed. If a function
    definition contains a "reads { ... }" clause, then every read
    _and_ write effect must be listed.
  * [drivers] syntax rules, metas, and preludes are inherited
    through cloning. Keyword "cloned" becomes unnecessary and
    is not accepted anymore.


version 0.80, Oct 31, 2012
==========================
  * [whyml] modified syntax for mlw programs; a summary of changes is
    given in Appendix A of the manual
  o [whyml] support for type invariants and ghost code
  o [api] Ocaml interfaces for constructing program modules
  o [transformation] experimental support for induction on integers
    and on algebraic types
  o [interface] new system of warnings, that includes:
     - form "exists x, P -> Q", likely an error
     - unused bound logic variables in "forall", "exists" and "let"
  o [replayer] new option -q, for running quietly
  * [session] improved output of "why3session latex"; LaTeX macros have
    more arguments
  o [prover] support for Coq 8.4
  * [prover] dropped support for Coq 8.2
  o [prover] support for forthcoming PVS 6.0, including realizations
  o [prover] support for iProver and Zenon
  o [prover] new output scheme for Coq using type classes, to ensures
    types are inhabited
  * [driver] theory realizations now use meta "realized_theory" instead
    of "realized"
  * [config] modifiers in --extra-config are now called [prover_modifier]
    instead of just [prover]

version 0.73, Jul 19, 2012
==========================
  o [IDE] "Clean" was cleaning too much
  * no more executable why3ml (why3 now handles WhyML files)
  o [Provers] support for Z3 4.0
  o [Sessions] a small change in the format. Why3 is still able to
    read session files in the old format.
  o completed support for the "Out Of Memory" prover result
  o [Why3ml] new construct "abstract e { q }"
  o [Coq output] quotes in identifiers remain quotes in Coq
  o [Coq output] default tactic is now "intros ..." with a pattern
    that matches the structure of the goal
  o [why3replayer] option -obsolete-only
  o workaround for a bug about modulo operator in Alt-Ergo 0.94
  o fixed a consistency issue with set.Fset theory
  o co-inductive predicates

    split tables in parts

version 0.72, May 11, 2012
==========================

  o new tool why3session (see manual, section 6.7)
  o new tool why3doc (see manual, section 6.8)
  o support for multiple versions of the same prover (see manual, section 5.5)
  o [why3ide] new features, including prover upgrade, alternate editors
  o complete support for limiting provers' memory usage
  o improved support on Microsoft Windows
  o fix BTS 14221
  o fix BTS 14190
  o fix BTS 12457
  o fix BTS 13854
  o fix BTS 13849
  o [syntax] new syntax "constant x:ty" and "constant x:ty = e" to
    introduce constants, as an alternative to "function"
  o [TPTP] new parser for TPTP files with support for the newest
    TFA1 format (TPTP with polymorphic types and arithmetic)
  o [API] Dtype declaration kind is split into two: Dtype for
    declarations of a single abstract type or type alias, and
    Ddata for a list of (mutually recursive) algebraic types.
    Similarly, Dlogic declaration kind is split into Dparam for
    a single abstract function/predicate symbol and Dlogic for
    a list of (mutually recursive) defined symbols.

version 0.71, October 13, 2011
==============================

  o [examples] a lot of new program examples in directory examples/programs
  o [Why3replayer] new option -latex to output a proof session in LaTeX format
  o [WhyML] significant improvement of the efficiency of the WP calculus
  o [WhyIDE] better coloring and source positioning including from front-ends
    such as Krakatoa and Jessie plugin of Frama-C
  o [WhyML] fixed labels and source locations in WPs
  o [Session] during reload, new method for pairing old and new subgoals
    based on goal shapes, stored in database.
  o [Session] prover versions are stored in database. A proof is
    marked obsolete if it was made by a prover with another version
    than the current.

version 0.70, July 6, 2011
==========================

  New features

  o [WhyML] language and VC generator
  o [syntax] record types
    - introduced with syntax "type t = {| a:int; b:bool |}"
      actually syntactic sugar for "type t = `mk t' (a:int) (b:bool)"
      i.e. an algebraic with one constructor and projection functions
    - a record expression is written {| a = 1; b = True |}
    - access to field a with syntax x.a
    - update with syntax {| x with b = False |}
    - record patterns
  o new tool why3replayer: batch replay of a Why3 session created in IDE
  o [Alt-Ergo/Z3/CVC3/Yices output] support for built-in theory of arrays

  Fixes and other changes

  * [syntax] new syntax for conjunction (/\) and disjunction (\/)
    ("and" and "or" do not exist anymore)
  * [syntax] "logic" is not a keyword anymore, use "function" and "predicate"
  o [IDE] interactive detection of provers disabled because incompatible
    with session. Detection must be done with why3config --detect-provers
  o [IDE] bug 12244 resolved by using Task.task_equal
  o [IDE] tool "Replay" works
  o [IDE] tool "Reload" reloads the file from disk. No need to exit IDE anymore
  o [IDE] does not use Threads anymore, thanks to Call_provers.query_call
  o [IDE] displays explanations using labels of the form "expl:..."
  o [IDE] dropped dependence on Sqlite3
  o [Alt-Ergo output] bugfix: no triggers for "exists" quantifier
  o [Coq output] bugfix: polymorphic inductive predicates
  o [Coq output] fixed bug 12934: type def with several type params
  * [API] functions to create an environment are now exported from Env
  * [API] calls to prover can now be asynchronous
    Driver.prove_task now returns some intermediate value
    (of type prover_call), which can be queried in two ways:
    - blocking way with Call_provers.wait_on_call
    - non-blocking way with Call_provers.query_call
    So old code performing "prove_task t () ()" should be translated to
    "wait_on_call (prove_task t ()) ()".

version 0.64, Feb 16, 2011
==========================

  o configure: if possible, use ocamlfind to find lablgtk2 and sqlite3
  o algebraic types: must be well-founded, non-positive constructors
    are forbidden, recursive functions and predicates must
    structurally terminate
  * syntax: /\ renamed into && and \/ into ||
  o accept lowercase names for axioms, lemmas, goals, and cases in
    inductive predicates
  o labels in terms and formulas are not printed by default.
  o transformation split-goal does not split under disjunction anymore
  o fixed --enable-local
  o why.conf is no more looked for in the current directory; use -C or
    WHY3CONFIG instead
  o why.conf: when changed, a backup up copy is made in why.conf.bak
  o why.conf now contains a magic number; configuration must be
    rebuilt with why3config if the magic number has changed
  o why3config: --autodetect-provers renamed to --detect-provers
                --autodetect-plugins renamed to --detect-plugins
     new option --detect to perform both detections
  o why3config: --conf_file is replaced by -C and --config
  o TPTP: encoding by explicit polymorphism is not anymore the
    default encoding for TPTP provers. It is now forbidden to use this
    encoding in presence of finite types.
  o IDE: source file names are stored in database with paths relative
    to the database, so that databases are now easier to move from a
    machine to another (e.g when they are stored in source control
    repositories)
  o better Gappa output: support for sqrt, for negative constants

version 0.63, Dec 21, 2010
==========================

  o first public release. See release notes in manual
